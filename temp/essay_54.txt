Essay:

"Now a days many people are using mobiles. It is good gargate to connect people very easy way. Where ever your and family members you can connect. 

Like most of the members are using social media like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Twitter there are so many social media site to connect with more and more people by creating of your personal accounts on social media. It's a good thing that we are connecting with our old as well as new friends will be adding in the list. 

So times it will create a good impact and some times it will leave the bad things in some one's life. The people are connecting and then shareing there information each other.some times it is going in positive way. Sometimes it will create a negative effect for life. It will spoil your life.

It's a good thing that we will connect with different culture people. It will explore your knowledge by the friends in social media. But in a negative way we don't about eachother better don't not share the personal information with that people. 

In my perception it a good to know about people how the society is going on in the world. But one thing I suggest though this but don't share the personal details with unknown people it will create a bad impression on yourself."
