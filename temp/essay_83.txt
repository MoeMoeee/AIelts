"Some people think that it is a good idea to socialise with work colleagues during evenings and weekends. Other people think it is important to keep working life completely seperate from social life."

Essay:

"Since our job take the majority of our daytime (or nighttime, that's depend on the job) our colleagues are a important part of our social life. We see them everyday and we usually have to interact with them many times. Do those interactions have to stay strictly professional or is it better including then in our private life?

First, that's depend on everyone's personnality. Some people are good to keep distance during the working time's interaction, keep neutral conversations and seprate clearly the private life and professional life. On a other side, some people can't control it and their personnality will push them to be friendly with people who they get along with or be distant tp people with who they feel inconfortable.

In fact, it is important to feel good at work. A heavy atmosphere caused by tensions between coworkers could effect very badly out life even when we come back home.

Socialize with work colleagues in the free time can be good occasion to know people better, away from the working stress and pressure. We can discover another part of personnality, hobbies. or personnal problems and then we can be more able to understand them during hard time at work.

Of course sometimes in an other hand some matters can appear when line between private and professional life start be fuzzy. For example, when two coworkers becam a couple and continue to work together or when a friendship between two workers can be gossips' start point.

But since we are all humans with our own sensitive points, it is important to be keep a good atmosphere at work by speaking out all the problems to release all the tensions. Communication is the key but also sharing a good time with coworkers away from work can be a nice way to understand more each other."
