Essay:

"Nowdays, We see many good or bad information from sns or newspaper or televion program 

Sharing the information is valuable for many people or Some shared free information if It is too valuable .We discuss about two different view.

To begin with ,  we can easily cheak about all different information from utube or sns . thoes media provide the information that is free so many people have benefit of valuable information from there. Eventhought ,pervery people had chanced to learn valueable skills .

In adance, person who lives run-down area does not have money to register privite shcool and living expense however, he had chanced to have a pupular skilled teather education class though utube without any paying.I assuem that this is positive way to share informtion .

On the other hand , a person who watch televion program choosen education program which given so good knownlogy . so a person leant  how to choosing stuck value with investment way  and than speaking to thier friends which is so valuable information freely for a person who interesting about stucks to invasting. however It is turn out that the program did not have basd to professal nation. some  people belive that some information is shard if it is good. 

In sum up , I agree that Information need to shared for  many people ,otherwise , we migh not know aboout what is valuable information or not . It is not usful a grand information usless information is not need to be free."
