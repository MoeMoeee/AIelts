"People are preferring their own vehicle over public transportation and this development has rapidly increasing last decade. Sevarel problem are being caused because of this such as air pollution ,traffic jams,late commute and so on.The solution is simple, government to encourage public transportation and inform vehicle users about to effect of detrimental .

Privet cars users need to understand that it is expensive and it is effected our environment.The first step is the introduction of high trolls in urban areas, and parking will be limited over the high price to park a private car. This step discourage to people who are use privet car. Privet cars users will be informed about the effect of detrimental and also privet car tax set will be high because of that it could demotivate car users.

The government should invest in public transport because it help to encourage to use public transport.For example, Air condition buses and trains will be the cheap rate for commuters. Making a public transport will be more attractive such as color, light and most importan is good buses driver. It will be satisfied commuters for everything. Less congestion in city is important, if government face the challenge then most of the poeple will be use public transpotation.
