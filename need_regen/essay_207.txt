Essay:

"As a human being who wants to get fit from time to time, sports play a big role to make us healthy. There are numerous type of sports in this world, yet, it can be divided into two sections, individual and team sports. While there are still debates over which type is better, here I would like to describe my views on both types and choose which one is better. 

Swimming, tennis, or even running are several sports that consider as individual sports. In this type of sports, our success is highly dependent on our performance and determination to achieve our goals. If the athletes want to be the winner, they must train harder than anyone else and set the goal as high as they can. Our achievements are not relying on outside factors. For example, Usain Bolt as a runner from Jamaica, always comes to the training earlier and trains as hard as he could. Therefore he achieves several medals at the Olympics. 

On the other hand, team sports such as basketball and football  count heavily on teamwork. Even though each individual has tremendous skills, if they cannot work as a team, their team will fail. As social creatures, human cannot life on their own, our life will be depends on someone. Therefore, teamwork will be one of the key for us to survive not only in sports, but also in our entire life. 

To summarize, both individual and team sports have their own benefits, however, to achieve more in sports and also in our life, I rather to choose team sports.

Revised:

Sports play an important role in keeping humans healthy and fit. While there are numerous types of sports, they can be broadly categorized into individual and team sports. Some people believe that playing team sports like football is more beneficial, while others argue that individual sports like tennis and swimming are better. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of sports and state my opinion on which one is better.

Individual sports such as swimming, tennis, and running depend on an athlete's performance and determination to achieve their goals. Success in individual sports is not dependent on external factors. For example, Usain Bolt, a Jamaican runner, won multiple medals in the Olympics by training harder than anyone else and setting high goals for himself.

Team sports like basketball and football rely heavily on teamwork. While individual skills are essential, the success of the team depends on how well the team members work together. As social creatures, human beings cannot survive on their own, and teamwork is crucial not only in sports but also in life.

In conclusion, whether an individual prefers to play individual or team sports is a personal choice. However, it is essential to recognize the benefits and drawbacks of both types of sports. While individual sports provide an excellent opportunity to develop personal skills and determination, team sports foster social and communication skills that are more valuable in the long run.


Feedback:

Task Response:?

Overall, your essay adequately addresses the question prompt. You discuss both views on the topic of whether individual or team sports are more beneficial, and you also express your own opinion. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to enhance the clarity and coherence of your ideas.

Firstly, it would be helpful to provide a stronger introduction that clearly presents the two contrasting views. Currently, your introduction briefly mentions the debate between individual and team sports, but it lacks a clear thesis statement. This can be remedied by explicitly stating whether you lean towards one side or if you will present both perspectives before offering your own opinion.

Secondly, while you mention a few examples to support your points, more specific and diverse examples could be included to illustrate the benefits of individual and team sports. For instance, you could elaborate on how individual sports promote self-discipline, personal growth, and self-confidence, while team sports build cooperation, communication skills, and camaraderie.

Furthermore, you could expand on the disadvantages of each type of sport. For individual sports, you could mention the potential for isolation or limited opportunities for teamwork. Likewise, for team sports, you could discuss the challenges of dealing with conflicts within the team or the dependence on other team members' performance.

Additionally, consider using more transition words and phrases to ensure smooth connections between your paragraphs and ideas. This will help guide the reader through your essay and make it easier to understand the flow of your arguments.

Revisiting the concluding paragraph, you state that both types of sports have benefits and drawbacks, but you do not explicitly state your own opinion, as you mentioned earlier. Make sure to clearly express your preference for team sports and briefly reiterate your reasons for choosing it.

In conclusion, your essay addresses the question prompt by discussing both views on the topic and providing your own opinion. However, it would benefit from improvements in the introduction, the inclusion of more specific examples, a thorough exploration of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of sport, the use of transition words, and a clear restatement of your opinion in the conclusion.
