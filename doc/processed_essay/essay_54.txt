Revised:

Nowadays, an increasing number of people are using the internet to contact existing friends and even make new friends. There are divergent opinions regarding whether this trend has strengthened or weakened relationships between existing friends. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my own viewpoint.

Supporters of the notion that the internet has strengthened relationships argue that it facilitates easier and quicker communication. With social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and Twitter, individuals can connect with a wide range of people by creating personal accounts. This enables us to reconnect with old friends and expand our social circle by making new friends. Consequently, our relationships can grow stronger as we have the opportunity to stay in touch and share experiences with a larger network of individuals.

On the other hand, critics argue that excessive use of social media can have a detrimental effect on relationships. They contend that interactions through the internet can be superficial and lack depth. Instead of engaging in face-to-face conversations or spending quality time together, people may become overly reliant on virtual communication. This can lead to a weakening of relationships, as the presence of physical interaction and emotional connection is reduced.

While there are advantages and disadvantages to using the internet to connect with friends, I believe that it ultimately depends on how individuals utilize this tool. Utilizing the internet to interact with friends from different cultures, for instance, can broaden our horizons and expand our knowledge about the world. It provides a platform for exchanging ideas and perspectives. However, it is important to exercise caution and not to divulge personal information to unknown individuals on these platforms. Sharing personal details with strangers can jeopardize our privacy and even pose risks to our safety.

In conclusion, the internet has revolutionized the way people communicate and connect. While it can contribute to strengthening relationships by facilitating easy and quick contact, it can also lead to superficial interactions and reduced personal connection. To make the most of this tool, it is important to strike a balance between virtual and face-to-face interactions, as well as exercise caution when sharing personal information online.

Task Response:

Overall, your essay does address the question prompt, which asks you to discuss both sides of the argument regarding whether the internet strengthens or weakens existing friendships. However, there are areas of improvement in terms of expanding on your ideas and providing more specific examples to support your points.

One area that needs improvement is the development of your arguments. While you mention the positive and negative impacts of using the internet to connect with friends, your reasoning is not fully developed. For example, you mention that connecting with different cultural people on social media can expand knowledge, but you do not provide any specific examples or further explanation to support this claim. It would be beneficial to include specific instances or anecdotes that illustrate how interacting with diverse individuals online can strengthen relationships.

Another aspect that needs improvement is the organization and structure of your essay. Currently, the essay lacks a clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. It is important to provide an engaging introduction that provides background information and a clear thesis statement. In the body paragraphs, you should present your arguments, supporting them with specific examples and evidence. Finally, in the conclusion, you should summarize your main points and provide your own opinion on the matter.

To improve your essay's coherence and cohesion, you should also focus on using appropriate cohesive devices throughout your writing. Cohesive devices such as transitional phrases, linking words, and pronouns help to connect ideas and improve the flow of your essay. Additionally, you should pay attention to maintaining a logical and consistent progression of ideas throughout your paragraphs.

In terms of providing a balanced argument, while you briefly mention both the positive and negative impacts of using the internet to connect with friends, your discussion lacks depth and balance. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, it would be beneficial to explore each side of the argument in more detail. For example, you could discuss how using the internet to contact existing friends can strengthen relationships through increased communication and the ability to stay connected despite distance. On the other hand, you could discuss the potential negative consequences such as decreased face-to-face interaction and the risk of encountering online predators.

Overall, while your essay does address the task prompt, there are areas for improvement in terms of expanding on your ideas, providing specific examples, and developing a more balanced and structured argument. By addressing these areas, you can enhance the overall effectiveness of your response.


Coherence and Cohesion:

Coherence and cohesion play a crucial role in making your essay easy to follow and understand. Let's evaluate the coherence and cohesion in your essay and identify areas that need improvement.

First, it's important to note that your essay lacks a clear structure. A well-structured essay typically consists of an introduction, body paragraphs that discuss the main points, and a conclusion. This structure helps organize your ideas and makes it easier for the reader to follow your argument.

To improve the structure, you can start by writing an introductory paragraph that introduces the topic and presents a thesis statement that outlines the main points you will discuss. For example, you can mention that the internet has become a popular tool for connecting with friends and making new ones, and then state that opinions differ on whether this trend strengthens or weakens relationships.

Next, you should develop separate body paragraphs for each side of the argument. Start each body paragraph with a topic sentence that clearly presents the main idea of that paragraph. In the first body paragraph, discuss how the internet can strengthen relationships by allowing people to maintain contact and share information easily. Support your argument with specific examples, such as how people can use social media platforms to stay in touch with friends from different parts of the world.

In the second body paragraph, discuss the negative aspects of using the internet to make friends. Talk about how this can lead to superficial relationships or even harm individuals if they share personal information with strangers. Provide examples, such as instances where people have been scammed or cyberbullied due to online connections.

For cohesion, you can use various transition words and phrases to connect your ideas and create a smooth flow in your essay. For instance, use introductory phrases like "On the one hand" and "On the other hand" to signal the shift between discussing the positive and negative aspects of internet friendships. Additionally, use linking words like "Furthermore" and "Moreover" to add supporting details to your arguments.

By implementing these improvements, your essay will have a better structure and clearer progression of ideas. This will enhance coherence and cohesion, making it easier for the reader to understand and follow your arguments. Remember to provide specific examples to support your points and use appropriate transition words and phrases to link your ideas throughout the essay.
