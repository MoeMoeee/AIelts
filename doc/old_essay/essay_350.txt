Topic:

"Some people decide to start their own busniess instead of working hour for a company or organization. Do the advantages for people working for their own business outweigh the disadvantages?"

Essay:

"Nowadays, the majority of individuals are inspired to be self-employed rather than being an employee in either a company or organization. I personally believe the benefits such as flexible working hours and opportunity to earn much more profit far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

To begin with, there is a plethora of advantages of being a self-employed businessman. Despite some struggles at the beginning, the start-uppers may become successful and create job opportunities for other people. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on work depends on willingness of the boss. Whether they work hard and long, and consequently earn lots of money, or they might shorten their working hours and as a result reduce their income, whereas in large companies, people only have an hourly salary, and it does not matter, whether they do their best at work or have worked extra, they will have the appointed salary. Moreover, there  are some people who can not work under someone's control, they want to have financial freedom and become independent, working on theirselves.

On the negative side, the self-employed individuals may face some difficulties at the real beginning of developing their business. Although, the bosses need to work extra in order to become successful at the opening stage of their business, however as their companies grow, the risks of losing everything might cause health problems for individuals. For instance, the recent investigation has demonstrated that, 9 out of ten companies become bankrupt in the first five-year period. Apart from this, people working for themselves can not enjoy all the perks and facilities, which are provided in world-scale companies, such as Amazon or Apple, which provide their employees with bonuses, paid vacations, health insurance and etc.

In conclusion, in spite of factors such as creating a successful empire and also, feel relaxed and confident, it is worth to begin a new job, however there are some disadvantages, which I consider as unimportant."


Revised:

"Nowadays, an increasing number of individuals are choosing to start their own businesses rather than work for companies or organizations. In my opinion, the advantages of working for oneself, such as flexible working hours and the potential to earn higher profits, outweigh the potential disadvantages.

To begin with, being self-employed offers numerous benefits. While there may be initial challenges, entrepreneurs have the opportunity to create jobs and contribute to economic growth. Moreover, self-employed individuals have the freedom to determine their own working hours and earn money based on their efforts. They have the flexibility to work more and increase their income, or choose to work fewer hours and have a reduced income. On the other hand, employees in large companies are typically paid a fixed salary regardless of their performance or the hours they put in. Additionally, some individuals may have a strong preference for financial independence and dislike working under someone else's management.

However, there are some potential drawbacks to self-employment. Entrepreneurs may face difficulties and uncertainties in the early stages of their business. As their companies grow, the risks associated with losing everything can cause stress and health problems. Statistics indicate that a significant number of start-ups fail within the first five years of operation. Furthermore, self-employed individuals do not have access to the same benefits and perks provided by multinational companies such as Amazon or Apple, such as bonuses, paid vacations, and health insurance.

In conclusion, despite the challenges involved in starting a business, the advantages of working for oneself outweigh the potential disadvantages. The ability to create a successful enterprise, have control over working hours, and enjoy financial independence are compelling reasons to pursue self-employment. While there may be some disadvantages, such as the risk of failure and the lack of corporate benefits, these factors are minor in comparison to the overall benefits of being one's own boss."

Coherence and Cohesion:?

Overall, the coherence and cohesion of your essay are good. Your ideas are well-organized and logically connected, making it easy for the reader to follow your arguments. However, there are a few areas where you can further enhance the coherence and cohesion of your essay.

1. Transition phrases: Although you have used some transition phrases like "To begin with", "Furthermore", "Moreover", and "In conclusion", it would be beneficial to include more transition phrases throughout your essay. These phrases can help to connect your ideas and create a smoother flow between paragraphs. For example, you can use phrases like "Additionally", "On the other hand", "In contrast", or "Similarly" to add coherence and show the relationship between ideas.

2. Sentence structure variation: Try to vary your sentence structures to maintain reader interest and create a better flow. Too many simple or compound sentences can become repetitive. Introduce complex sentences or use subordination and coordination to connect ideas. For example, instead of repeatedly starting sentences with "Moreover" or "However", you can rephrase a sentence to make it more complex. 

3. Examples and evidence: While your essay contains some good examples to support your points, it would be beneficial to include more specific and relevant examples. These examples can further strengthen your arguments and provide more clarity to your ideas. Additionally, ensure that the examples are directly related to the topic sentence and are clearly linked to the main point you are trying to convey.

By paying attention to these suggestions, you can enhance the coherence and cohesion of your essay, making it even stronger in terms of structure and organization.


Lexical Resource:

1. "Start-uppers" - Trong văn viết, thay vì từ này, bạn có thể sử dụng "entrepreneurs" để diễn đạt người khởi sự kinh doanh.

2. "Plethora" - Từ này có nghĩa là một số lượng lớn, nhưng nó không chính xác hoặc phù hợp với ngữ cảnh bạn đang sử dụng. Thay vào đó, bạn có thể sử dụng các từ được sử dụng phổ biến hơn như "a wide range/variety of" hoặc "numerous."

3. "Create job opportunities" - Thay vì sử dụng cụm từ này, bạn có thể sử dụng "generate employment" hoặc "provide employment opportunities" để diễn đạt ý tưởng một cách chính xác hơn.

4. "Work on theirselves" - Đây là một lỗi ngữ pháp. Đúng là "work on themselves" để diễn đạt ý tưởng làm việc độc lập.

5. "Perks and facilities" - Từ "perks" dùng để chỉ các phúc lợi, phần thưởng ngoài lương và "facilities" chỉ các cơ sở vật chất. Cả hai từ này có ý nghĩa đúng, nhưng không phù hợp với ngữ cảnh của câu. Thay vào đó, bạn có thể dùng cụm từ "additional benefits and amenities" hoặc "extra incentives and resources."
