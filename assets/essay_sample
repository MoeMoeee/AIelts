"Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebration while others think it is a waste of money.Discuss both views"

Essay:
"Celebration seems as a festival because of the way they are performed and a way of bringing people together.majority believe that it is paramount to spend lavishly on a family celebration while others believes otherwise.This essay will discuss both views and my notion.

On one hand,many think it is important to spend too much money on family occasion.This is because these days, people rarely get time to be with each other and it is through family ceremony they spend time together.For instance, an uncle of mine who lives in other country comes home every family gathering to spend time with the family and he spend a lot of money whenever he is around.hence there is need to spend time with the family

On the other hand, others think spend money in a family celebration is a waste of time.This is because of some family occasion is just one day and people at times spend a lot of money which can be for donations rather than spending it lavishly.Also if too much money is spend like that people will not have any saving for themselves at the end of the family gathering.In addition, their standard of living may decrease and will not be able to cope with the modern society.

In conclusion,a lot of people debate whether money should be spend extravagantly or not with the above reasons"

"Some people think it's better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it's good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them. Discuss both the views and give your opinion."

Essay:
"Friendship is the only unconditional relationship in people's life as they are not obliged towards each other but still can rely on one another. Many argued that people should make friends with those, who have similar views, while others opine that people who have different opinions or do not always agree will be  good friends. I will articulate both  notions with a plausible explanation prior to giving my opinion.

On the one hand, People believe that having friends with the same thought process is better because they can be a good companions and will have a better understanding. In other words, when two persons with the same ideas and thoughts become friends, they can help each other to achieve their goals and there will be very less chances of conflicts. 

On the other hand, some individuals opine that friends with different opinions will be good because, it is very important to have someone in life who can tell an individual truth with compassion, without any fear of losing a friend. Moreover, this kind of friendship also aids in get  success in life as they can provide different perspectives towards problems to each other. Besides this, they get an opportunity to learn new things from one another experiences.

To conclude, in my ,opinion both kinds of friends have their own role in an individual's life. Friends with the same view are easy to get along with and with different opinions will get a different vision to look towards things."

"There have been major advances in technology over recent decades and this has led to significant improvements in people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Developments in technology in recent years has brought great impacts to the lives of individual in the society today. I strongly believe that the current positive changes in technology has improved people's lives. 

One of the main impact of technology on individual's lives is that, it  generate employment opportunities in different organizations. People who are computer literate have been able to be employed to various organizations like airports, companies, banks, and hospitals. All these organizations depend on technology in their day to day activities. For instance, computer experts have been able to be employed to places like bank and they make use of computer to store their data. Also, many medical practitioner have been considered for job opportunity because of their knowledge of computer. Secondly, development of technology improves level of communication. Many people from various places have been able to communicate maximally through the use of telephones, electronic mails and other social media handles. To illustrate, a  friend of mine was able to apply for a job inside her room, this application was sent via electronic mail and the organization replied back within two days of application. In addition, people have been able to reach out to one another through the use of telephone.

However, technology has helped to reduce the workload at home and also improved means of transportation.Household chores like washing clothes and plates, have been made easier by the use of washing machine. Cars, aeroplanes, ships and trains have serve as means of transportation for people and goods. For example, initially, I normally spend about three hours washing my clothes but with the help of technology, I have been able to use washing machine for washing clothes under thirty minutes. Furthermore I get to my place of work easily buy driving my car.

In summary, although there are a lot of benefits attached to the advent of technology but our daily activities should not be dependent on it."

"SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD STUDY WHATEVER THEY LIKE. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO STUDY SUBJECTS THAT WILL BE  USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
DISCUSS BOTH THESE VIEWS AND GIVE YOUR OPINION."

Essay:
"Some humans believe that students in tertiary institutions should have the right to study the courses they like. However, other people believe that they should offer courses that will be beneficial later in life

In this essay, I will analyze the points and present my view in favour of people who believe that students should be given the right to study the courses they like.

On one side, having a chance to study science and technology-related courses can bring many benefits. First of all, the world is evolving every day with the use of technology especially the health line. Most devices used in the hospital are implemented by technology talking about the intensive care unit. This helps in making work easy and also reduces the rate at which patients die. However, I still believe that students should be given the chance to study courses they like because not everyone has the ability to cope with science and technology-related courses and also studying their dream courses will benefit them and also the community at large just like those who studied science and technology related courses.

On the other side, Students can be better prepared for the career they like because more time will be spent on studying what they are interested in and also they will learn with more enthusiasm because they will learn what they like.

Personally, I think that some courses studied in  tertiary institutions aside from the science and technology-related courses are also well recognized because of their impact laid in  society. Talking about the lawyers and judges who give justice to situations. This has helped  society at large by making it a favourable atmosphere for us all to live in.When students are given the opportunity to study the courses they like it gives them the opportunity to extend their range of interest and also helps them develop important characteristics such as self-confidence, and high self-esteem because they were not forced to study courses they did not like."

"The arts, including art, music and theatre are considered to be important in society.

Do you think the arts still have a place amongst our modern lifestyles?

Should the arts be included in the school curriculum"

Essay:
"Nowadays, art cannot be apart from human life, while creativity is one aspect that is paramount to support our activities. Artists and entertainers need that skill in their job to entertain people. Thus, I believe art is an essential aspect of modern society and should be embraced in education from the first level to university life. 

To begin with, entertainment such as music and art gallery is indeed important for people to cope with stressful and pressure daily routine jobs because they will assist to make relax and be happy. Subsequently, art also has a place to create job opportunities for many young people due to it broadening job vacancy in creative sectors in a big city. Thus, arts still have a place in the current modern lifestyle.

On the other hand, education is of higher standard in a city and modern life necessity, although in the current situation, science and technology are merely more popular rather than art. In fact, art should be embedded in all curriculum subjects of study from primary school to university to encourage  creativity and have a good sense of their product-making, regardless of their educational background. For instance, when pupils add art sense to their creation to make the user interfaces of apps, it leads to eye-catching and colourful.

In conclusion, art cannot be imparted from current modern life as well as it should be attached to all levels of education from elementary to university. Therefore, I believe artistically is still massively needed since then to this era in making people enjoy and colourful life."

Essay:
"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that governments of wealthy countries should take more obligation for assisting impoverished countries in such areas. Now people are beginning to realize that development depends on the joint efforts of a large number of different groups. Personally, I tend to think that everyone should assist to each other in difficult times.

Firstly, it is well known that a large number of rich lands have an opportunity to help. What I mean here is that they are able to create distinct events in support of poor society. One of the main reasons behind that is they have a wide range of facilities due to this they may pool their resources and improve lives in impoverished countries. A good case in point is providing jobs for qualified people from economically backward nations, so both sides can obtain mutual benefit and strengthened their relations. 

On the other hand, it can also be argued that only rich countries must be responsible. That is to say poor nations should aim to become self-sufficient and do not attempt to rely on someone. Take for example, the situation with the COVID 19 pandemic, when the entire world was going through financial turmoil and needed assistance. Therefore, poor countries suffer enormously due to the lack of a competent economy and proper conditions for life so what they should do is consider every single detail in the development of the country to escape such terrible circumstances.

In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account in our final analysis we can say that the optimum solution is to provide market access so the region can produce products and obtain regular income."

Essay:
"Some people believe that children should be taught by their parents about how to function as useful members of society, while others believe that sending children to educational institutions is the best way for them to study this. Although the latter opinion can be beneficial in some cases, I believe that family upbringing plays a more important role in educating children to be good parts of the community.

Schools can be considered suitable places for children to learn to be good citizens. With standardized educational methods, schools can foster children’s cognitive development so that they are able to contribute to society in the future. For example, Trung Vuong school and Vinschool are well known for having nurtured successful alumni such as Professor Ngo Bao, Professor Nguyen Hung who have devoted their talents to the development of the country. However, these people only represent a small fraction of the total number of students attending schools, and thus sending children to schools cannot be the best method of educating them to be good members of society. 

I believe that parents play a more important role in teaching them how to be good citizens. In Vietnam, the average class size is 20 students, which makes it difficult for educators to provide proper schooling for each student. One to one lessons at home, on the other hand, allow children to progress faster. Furthermore, parents form stronger bonds with their offspring and thus, it is easier for them to shape children’s personalities at an early age. For example, by telling stories such as Robin Hood, Cinderella before bedtime, parents can instil a sense of compassion and integrity into them. These children are likely to become good members of society when they grow up.

In conclusion, although sending children to schools can be seen as a way of teaching them how to be good citizens, I believe that domestic upbringing has a bigger impact on determining who they are in the future."

"There is an increasing trend around the world of married couples deciding not to have children. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for couples who decide to do this."

Essay:
"An increasing number of married couples around the world choosing to remain childless. The main benefits of not having a child for couples are that they can focus on their careers and have more time for themselves. The main drawbacks are that they could not fit into their peers’ group and have no one to look after them when they get old. 

One primary advantage of remaining childless for married couples is that they can focus on their work. This is because they have less responsibility and distractions in their lives compared to the couples that have a child. Another advantage of this is that they have more spare time. Looking after a child is a full-time job for parents and taking most of their time, while child-free couples have lots of free time after work. For example, many couples stop going out late with their friends after having a child as they have to stay at home for looking after their children. 

One disadvantage of couples deciding not to have children is that they can struggle to hang with their peers after most of them have children. Most parents prefer to spend more time with other couples that have children as well. Moreover, do not have anyone to look after them in their elderliness is another disadvantage. Children are the ones who take care of their parents when they get old because their parents did the same for them when they were young. For instance, the vast majority of the people who live in care homes have no child. 

In conclusion, the main benefits of staying child-free for couples are that they can be more career-oriented and have more free time for themselves, and the main drawbacks are that they could have problems about fitting into their friends’ group and having no one to take care of them when they become older."

Essay:
"Some would say that parents should teach their offspring how to be good members of society, while others are of the opinion that school is the best in this regard. This essay agrees with the latter point and will show that, despite the practical experiences that parents give their children, school lessons can give deep insights into what it takes to be good citizens.

Some believe that parents can educate their children about being good members of society based on their life experiences. This is because the life experiences that parents can give their children are straightforward, down-to-earth, and so they can easily apply what their parents teach them in reality. For example, many children in Thailand become more polite, honest, and caring to everyone as a direct result of the practical lessons that their parents give them at home. However, I believe that parents now are so busy and do not spend much time with their children teaching them.

Lessons at school can provide children with valuable insights into being good members of society. In class, students can receive lessons about different traits of a truly good person that society needs, and then they put what they learn into practice by creating real-life problems and solving them together. For instance, after receiving lessons in civic education at school, many Vietnamese students are more willing to help their neighbors and even strangers, and they feel extremely happy after doing something good for others. For this reason, I believe that school lessons are more influential to young children. 

In conclusion, despite the practical experiences that parents can give their children at home, this essay believes that school lessons can help students deepen their understanding of being good members of society."

Essay:
"In many professional sports, it is becoming commonplace for athletes to abuse prohibited substances to boost their overall performance. This essay will discuss how stiff competition and lax testing systems are the main cause of this problem, and the most suitable solutions are imposing heavier punishments on violators and revamping testing facilities.

The main cause of this problem is the fierce competition that exists in any sports. In other words, most many professional athletes feel that they have to take substances like steroids to give themselves an advantage over other strong opponents. Another reason is the lack of strictness in testing procedures. Many athletes who take advantage of banned substances can still get off scot-free due to the holes in testing systems. For example, a high-profile mix martial artist named Jon John who is notorious for using PED described how easy it was to get away with cheating in an interview in 2015.

A viable solution is to heavily punish lawbreakers. If sports clubs and establishments raise the fine for using banned substances, many athletes will think twice before making attempt to cheat. Another the way to deal with this issue is to upgrade testing amenities. This will eradicate any holes existing in the system and ensure that the test result is highly accurate. For instance, after the UFC had made major investments to provide their staff with the latest testing equipment, many fighters in their organization got caught.

In conclusion, strong competition and ineffective testing systems are the main cause of this problem, and the most suitable solutions are enforcing harsher punishments on violators and reforming testing facilities."

"Some say that music, art and drama are as important as other school subjects, especially at the primary level. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Some people believe that arts-related subjects are as important as other school subjects, especially for primary school children. I totally agree with this statement because this can help children to discover their talents from an early age and can increase their confidence. 

One of the reasons I agree that creative subjects have the same importance as other school courses in primary school is that it allows students to find out their potential talents early on. That is to say, school-age is the most convenient time for students to learn more about their interests by trying different activities as they are young enough to pursue their hobbies. They will probably not have any other chance later in their lives to discover that because they will be busy with difficult exams when they get older. For example, most famous singers were discovered by their music teachers at school from a young age, and they claimed that they could not be that successful if their teachers did not find out their talents when they were young.

Moreover, music, art and drama subjects help students to boost their confidence. That is because creative lessons teach students how to perform in front of lots of people and give them a chance to socialise with other students. As a result, students can realise their real potential and act more confidently. For instance, many psychologists suggest to students who are struggling with social anxiety to take drama lessons as it helps to enhance confidence. 

In conclusion, this essay completely agrees that music, art and drama have the same value as other subjects in primary school because it allows children to discover their hidden talents early on and increases their self-confidence."

"Multinational companies are becoming increasingly common in developing countries. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?"

Essay:
"It is becoming more popular in developing nations to see multinational corporations. There are some benefits for this trend such as the progress in the economy they create in these countries and the availability of jobs, however, the shut down of some small local businesses and the lower selling rate of local products can be its drawbacks.

The main advantage of the increasing number of these types of companies is the economic progress. That is to say, if multinational organizations operate in less-developed nations, this can bring wealth which boosts industries, trade, and other aspects of the economy. Moreover, more jobs will be available for the local people. That is because more workers and managers are needed to work for these companies which can be a good opportunity for locals to find a job. For instance, after opening a branch of Apple company in Dubai, many local graduates were thrilled by the good news of being accepted to work under this renowned company. 

However, one of the main disadvantages of this trend is the drop in the selling rate of the local products. That is because of the good reputations and qualities of international items, and, thus, citizens might refrain from buying their local products. Another disadvantage is that some small local shops could be closed. That is due to the unfair competition with these huge strong establishments, and as a result, some might be shut down or go bankrupt. For example, many amateur Syrian entrepreneurs, and after the harsh competition they had with international textile corporation, were forced to close their fabric factories. 

In conclusion, although the advantages of the popularity of multinational organizations in developing countries are the economic progress and the improvement in the job market, nonetheless, its downsides are the drop in the average selling of local products and the closure of some small businesses."

Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion"

Essay:
"Many people think that parents should allow their children make daily decisions, but others are concerned that doing so can raise self-serving individuals. Personally, I believe that we should let them make the decision.

On the one hand, children grew by extremely strict parents tend to be social introverts. They had to obey all of their parents' rules as children, regardless of what they wanted to do. For instance, they might be particularly skilled in gaming or working with technology. However, their parents want them to become physicians or engineers. Since they are unable to pursue their own interests, they develop a lack of ambition. Therefore, it is crucial to allow kids make decisions or think about what they want to do from an early age.

On the other side, individuals who grew up with their parents in relatively open relationships frequently lack empathy for others. This occurs because they always received from their guardian what they want and did not have to consider if it was right or wrong. It is their parents' fault, not their own. Elders should teach kids whether or not they are being sensible so that they understand that things don't always go the way they do in movies. Because of this, it is also crucial to manage some of their early emotions.

My parents educated me and instilled in me the value of considering all possibilities and their effects before acting. Today, I developed into a person who can express my needs to others while also knowing what I really desire. Therefore, I think it is the parents' primary responsibility to always make sure their children are on the right track."

Essay:
"In some nations, there is an increasing number of homeowners who show interest in delving into the past of the house or building they reside in. This essay will look at some possible causes and offer  multiple ways to help residents investigate this.

Firstly, understanding the home’s history can help people to know whether they can or can’t alter parts of the building. If individuals are aware of the background of their houses, they will be provided with a better understanding of the condition including construction materials used or how the house evolved. This information, therefore, prevents owners from causing irreparable damage to original features. Secondly, many people look for the story of their homes because they are curious. To illustrate, some remnants such as a portrait of a family member, or some novels left by the previous occupants might trigger curiosity about who they were.

There are several methods which can enable people to find out about the history of where they live in. To begin with, they can look for the seniors in their neighbourhood to ask questions. These people have been living in the area for years and staying in touch with previous owners so they know a lot about what happens behind the walls. Hence, they can share things and provide the necessary information. In addition, census records are helpful for new homeowners. Thanks to these, individuals are able to discover the names of family members who lived in the home, as well as their marital status, occupations, and other intriguing information.

In conclusion, looking at the past of a property is essential if a person wants to make some changes to the house or to find the answer to unsure past events. In order to find the answer, residents can seek old people living in nearby areas or look up old census records."

Essay:
"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.

On the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.

 The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.

On the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.

 Moreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits.

In conclusion, it is probably a great idea to make the deserts and chocolates expensive as it can cut off the buyers but there are other practical measures that need to be taken which have a greater impact."

Essay:
"In modern society, trying to revolutionize the country has been a communities' s concern. Development needs a variety of elements such as determination, power and finance. While individuals feel overwhelmed when paying taxes to share responsibility,  others denied their exclusion in giving a hand in. This essay will illustrate both points of view on this trend.

On the one hand, it is  argued that paying taxes is made for each citizen. Therefore, everyone should spend a part of their salary on the government. It is because they are living in the same habitat, same city, and same government so it is reasonable to contribute such a little contribution. Another reason for forcing each person to pay taxes is that budget can be built for many facilities. For example, if just one person pays compulsory fees, not much can be done by a small sum of money. However, if it is a colossal number of participants, there will be a huge impact on the city's development . As diagnosed by GiaDinh's newspaper, many laconic developments have been created by citizens' contributions. 

On the other hand, it is strongly believed that spending compulsory cost isn't a crucial duty. People often have this opinion because of the paying ability of the poor. Although some people are available to give a part of their salary not to their parents or themselves, it seems ruthless when equality is shown by resemblance taxes for everyone including the poor. The exchange in sacrificing their limiting money is not a consolation. For example, as reported by Vogue, 40% of people in the world are not able to pay the contributing fee. 

In conclusion, people are said to give a hand to developing the country. Therefore, the pay should be personalised to suit everyone in various ways. In my opinion, making a contribution to country development should be compulsory for every citizen. However, it's not true for the disadvantaged or the disabled. Noticeably, I think the contribution is our responsibility but not for all the citizens. The specific group of disadvantaged people should have  suitable contributing parts."

"Today’s schools should teach their students how to survive financially in the world today. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?"

Essay:
"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is teaching students how to be financially competent in the world. Now people are beginning to realize that schools need to add such clasess where children will be taught how to handle money. Personally, I tend to think think that it is a great opportunity for kids to become more informed and even succesfull. 

Firstly, it is well known that it is more convenient to teach people financial literacy from an early age because they convey information very easily. What I mean here is that they will know the value for funds and will be more accurate when purchasing something. One of the main reasons behind that is those kids will never complain about the lack of money because they had already broadened their horizons and know how to deal with distinct financial difficulties. A good case in point is children will be able to handle a salary for expensive things such as houses or cars which is the goal of every adult. 

On the other hand, it can also be argued that only this kind of lesson should be educated at schools. That is to say teachers should pay a lot of attention to other subjects because students have to obtain proper education not only how to be skilled at funding. Take for example, there are a wide range of kids who may not be interested in finance, so it is crucial to consider that fact and not to focus on only one aspect. 

In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account we can say that there are both pros and cons to this purpose, however, it would not be superfluous in the lives of young people, it can only provide the best future"

"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Humanity has always been experimenting with different technologies to make sales perform better. In recent years, online shopping websites and apps have become quite popular, which makes some individuals think that they can close down offline shops. In my opinion this claim is overstated and it is not going to happen in the near future. However, online services may be more preferable for certain people.

On the one hand, offline shops afford people the opportunity to make more deliberate and weighed decisions on items to buy. This is especially the case for clothes, as it is much more convenient to try on them immediately in a fitting room. Another significant benefit of offline shops is that a person can ask for a consultation from a seller. This is crucial for older individuals, who need extra guidance and assistance during their shopping. For instance, my grandparents are not advanced users of the internet, therefore they always choose to see products they want to buy with their own eyes.

On the other hand, online services have developed substantially over the recent years. They are constantly looking for new opportunities to make their apps and websites convenient to as many users as possible. The reason for that is the advanced improvement of internet technologies, which allows them to experiment with different styles of user interface to find the ones that perform better for everyone.

In conclusion, the majority of individuals use online services because of their convenience. However, there will always be people who find them difficult to use or simply enjoy the offline shopping experience. This is the reason why offline shops are going to coexist with online apps and websites making shopping available for all the people."

"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"In recent times we have had an increase in online shopping and certain individuals believe it will lead to the closure of shops in towns and cities. Although we have reasons to agree with this, I disagree with this notion and in this essay, I will state my reasons.

Firstly, online shopping has been helpful to a lot of people especially the working class who have limited time to visit the market. With this, they are able to stay in the comfort of their homes or office and place an order for most items on a website. Secondly, for items manufactured in a location far from the buyer, they can be ordered online and shipped to them. For example, we have goods produced in China or in Vietnam and they are displayed on a particular website and then can be purchased and shipped to the buyer's location in Nigeria.

On the other hand, we have a lot of fashion items that are better off bought in a physical store. Personally, I have purchased dresses and shoes online which were sent to me and were not my size. For example, I purchased a dress online in a large size but it was delivered as a medium-sized dress. As a result, I had to return the dress and incurred extra costs for shipping. Also, I bought a footwear on a website and it was delivered two sizes smaller than my size. This in turn can also lead to me wasting money as I end up giving the item out or I have to wait for so long to get it replaced. Another issue is with household utensils and perishable goods. Purchasing these items online is not favourable as they might get to the buyer damaged and in terrible conditions in the process of delivering the item. For example, an individual decides to order foodstuffs like tomatoes or glassware like mugs and plates online. In most cases, the tomatoes are delivered rotten, while the mugs and plates are delivered broken as a result of carelessness by the delivery man which can be avoided if an individual goes to personally purchase the items.

In conclusion, although online shopping is a great medium for obtaining goods and services, it can never lead to the closure of all stores in towns and cities as individuals avoid getting items they cannot use as a result of the wrong size and will have the luxury to pick from various design and check different stores."

"Giving detail information of Crime in newspaper and on television has bad consequences, some suggest that government should impose some restriction on them. What extent you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"It is sometimes argued that the huge popularity of violent information on social media can be attributed to harassment, thus, some data should be restricted. I completely agree with this statement.

First of all, in the era of globalization, People can get bombarded with numerous mass media which are reachable to everyone whether adults or adolescents. Thus, some harmful behaviours shown in criminal news can bring about crime in children or dangerous actions. For example, in the last 10 years, mass murders have increased because people, youth in particular, copy this threatening action from detailed information about a murder on television. Furthermore, by being published in public, severe images being normalized will allow children to view them as a common incident. For instance, in America, an abundance of pupils have been killed by their own schoolmates who try to imitate this hazardous behaviour from a computer game that they commonly take  every day.

Consequently, To tackle this problem, they should limit the age of certain dangerous news and censor harsh pictures, thus, these cruel mediums can be less and less accessible to youngsters. Moreover, citizens ought to be educated about data purification, hence, they will be able to distinguish what should be delivered by them. For example, the criminal process should no longer be shown in media because children will imitate this conduct, moreover, parents should counter this attack by controlling their kids when they are delivered messages from television.

To conclude, from my perspective, this statement is correct. to overcome this dangerous action, the government should keep the medium, newspapers and television, in particular, free of violation by limiting the detail."

"Is freedom of speech vital in free society how far do you agree"

Essay:
"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is the necessity of the right to speak in an independent society. Personally, I tend to think that the liberty of speech is valuable for the community due to the facts that the freedom of expression leads to the state's evolution and the absence of this phenomenon encourages the vanishing of the justice system. 

Firstly, it is well known that in the case of every citizen having an autonomy of choice, it contributes to the government's progress. What I mean here is that the authorities must perform improvements if the civilians have a right to speak about the community issues which positively impacts the prosperity of the country. Otherwise, the governance will not have a vision of problems as the locals are out of the opportunity to put a light to those obstacles. A good case in point is a comparison of two powers the USA and the USSR. Compared to the USSR, the USA has given their people full freedom of speech and as a result, the USA is still leading the top of advanced countries in the world whilst the USSR is collapsed years ago.

The other aspect of this problem to discuss is that the justice system cannot exist if the state has the power to close the mouth of the population. As long as the people cannot stand for themselves, the authorities will not have a pathway to see this matter through the perspectives of these individuals. Take North Korea for example which differs from other modern countries by deprivation of rights to speak. Consequently, the community is suffering from unfairness, because the person can be quilted for things that are adequate in unrelated countries. 

In conclusion, we can say that for development of the government and existion of the average justice system the right to voice one’s opinion is considerably crucial."

"Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion."

Essay:
"In today's world there are two opinions about whether or not it is beneficial to get a higher education at universities. Some tend to think that doing a degree is the best way to be a high-paid employee, whereas others' opinion is that hands-on learning and people skills are more essential. I will discuss both of these views and express my opinion .

There are groups of people who think that it is necessary to finish a university because without educational background there are fewer chances to get a good profession. University education provides a lot of courses that will teach students about important skills that will help them in their future job. On top of that, teachers are subject specialists and have excellent experiences which can be helpful for their learners. Therefore, some people think that completing a university education is a thing that should be done by students anyway.

Turning to the other side of the argument, others' view is that experience and soft skills are more pivotal than education at the university. The reason is that sometimes students can have a good education, but they do not know, for example, how to behave with people politely, they do not have an experience in answering correctly in different situations, such as when a customer does not like the thing that he has bought and get angry. Thus, people think that is more pivotal to get experience rather than education.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I tend to think that it is necessary for everyone to get a higher education because it provides a wide selection of opportunities for students."

This essay intends to discuss the importancde of sport in anyones life.

There are myriad advantages of sports curriculm as they significantly effect the health of human beings. For example, research in The United States proved that students who enrolled in a school with sports curriculm demonstrate more effective result as compared to those students who get admitted in traditional schools, thus, this example illustrates the importance of sports in ones life. Without such sport practices we may turn our new generations in robotics as they may not able to live lively without fears. 

Many advance nations know the importance of sport subjects and encourages their population to practice sports on daily basis by introducing the free sports clubs. For instance, Japan has introduuced various free sports clubs for schools where students practics and get mentally fresh, albeit a little tired, as a result they become more productive. 

Following this look, it is clear that sports play a significant role in human life; need arises that impiment sport curriculum should impliment as necessasity course in all instituations, thus, I hope for the beterment of humanbeing this may occour as soon as possible."

"The governments investment in art such as music and theatre is a waste of money, government must invest money on public service instead. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"The Authorities Investing in art is a normal and old way business in which the government invest more in public services but, recently public demand has become more essential than art.Therefore, I will agree that the authorities should divert the money to invest in public demand such as the construction of good Roads and the provision of good water supply being more important than craft.This shall be expatriates in the essay.

The Authorities should spend more money on social needs such as roads than art because not everyone loves art despite the fact that it has its own health benefits but having good roads superseded it. For ,example when one is sick and needs to access health care on time with good roads, Heath care services will be rendered without any complications But when the roads are bad the person's condition will  become worst along the journey and death might occur.

In addition to the above, governments should invest more in providing a good water supply.As we all know that water is a major requirement for man to survive on Earth, after getting access to water if, the water consumed is unhygienic it will jeopardize the person's health. Good drink results in a good community and state. For instance, when people are always getting sick due to the consumption of unhygienic drinks, the governments will not have peace of mind, and money will be wasted on drugs instead of achievements in well-being.moreso if care is not taken life will be lost.

Conclusively, in contrast to the Government's investment in the craft such as music and theatre rather than public service, I will agree that money should be diverted to public services like the construction of good roads and the provision of good water that will help to have a good developing environment."

"Some people think that schools should not test and grade students. Others think that grades are important. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion."

Essay:
"While some individuals believe that pupils should not be tested or given grades in educational institutions, others are convinced that learners cannot evade without a grading system. To my mind, while testing can be beneficial for various reasons, schools should make systemic improvements to allow children to study without feeling under pressure.

To begin with, students can assess their progress using standardized tests. The scale allows teachers and learners to see how a pupil is doing in relation to the rest of the class. Not only does this help college admissions committees assess who is ready for college-level academics, but it can also assist them in identifying students who require additional support. Furthermore, learners consider grades to be a reflection of their intelligence. They may feel proud of themselves if they get high grades through effort. The feeling of success will encourage students to study harder.

On the other hand, the grading system is a wholly unreliable source of metrics in school. Students will endeavor to meet requirements that help them to get a high score and less on learning. Therefore, educational institutions should abandon the grading system in order to give students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and not be afraid to make mistakes. For instance, schools in Europe create a welcoming atmosphere where students may experiment and cultivate a passion for learning that lasts a lifetime. Students can concentrate more on their academic growth and avoid being unduly concerned with getting high marks when they are under less pressure to succeed.

To sum up, the grading system is a credible standard that encourages students to improve their academic performance. However, it may not accurately reflect the learner's knowledge; therefore, schools with reduced focus on grades encourage students to study without overdependence on high scores."

These days, people work in more than one job, and often change career several times during their life. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?

Essay:

People often tended to have a fixed job that could last for their lifetime in the past, but it is changed now. For many individuals, job change has been their purpose in life nowadays. In this essay, I will outline what I consider to be some positive and negative parts of this trend.

Certainly, there are several key benefits stemming from changing jobs frequently. One of them is to gain more experience in a different environment. In one company, for example, the longer an employee works, the more routined tasks are. Thus, moving to a new organisation can allow the worker to learn a different thing. Another key benefit is that people may get higher pay in a new job. It is reported that the pay may rise up to 30% for those who choose to move on with a new entity, while, in contrast, it is only 10% for a regular annual salary increment. Clearly, changing jobs is very attractive. 

However, it does have its limitations. Job-hopping can be difficult because people need to start afresh. They need to go through a probation period many times, learning the basics and gradually involving in an important project if a manager believes in their abilities and values. I myself, for instance, took 2 years to understand and master a new career but finally quit to return to the previous company due to stress. In addition to this difficulty, the person may end up unemployed if they fail to pass the probation or if they cannot get along with their new colleagues. If they cannot find a new job to continue, it ultimately creates a financial issue as well. 

In conclusion, having a job changed is a choice of each person for their future career and better life. If anyone decides to move on with a new career, it is better for them to take some time to consider all potential problems and be well-prepared to overcome them.

Some people believe that exercise is the key to good health while others feel that having a balanced diet is more important. Discuss both side and give your opinion.

Essay:

In modern days, activity and diet is plays an important role from day to day behavior and provide strength and a lot of goodness. It is often argued by some that task is most beneficial, it develops functional organs and maintains body fitness. Meanwhile, others argue that a balanced diet is more helpful, it provides high rich nutrients. This essay will discuss both sides of argument before reaching a logical opinion in the following paragraphs.

Based on my knowledge, the former group focuses that regular act enables them to live or life free from diseases. As few nation indulge themselves in activities such as jogging, walking, cycling and swimming, they burn excess calories and this helps them to lose weight and more merits for mind and body organs. For example, a survey conducted by the World Health Ministry  revealed  that geriatric persons who suffer modern behavior like obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus because they are practising walking and maintaining day-to-day warm-up action to control the disease level and increasing state of health. Hence, workout play an important role in maintaining a healthy behavior.

While on the other hand, the advocates of the idea that having a balanced diet is even more significant. Most of the reason why they think is because of poor quality foods that public consume these days. In many markets or shopping malls, organic food products and food which are free from chemicals are hardly found. For instance, Many Researches have proven that a diet which is balanced in vitamins and minerals, which is free from any chemicals is essential to keep public healthy. Thus, nutrients based diet is  more helpful to ensure good health.

However, in my opinion both performance and a balanced diet are extremely beneficial on their own

ways. It is a matter of choice, like in which pattern they population are more comfortable.

To conclude, having the habit of lesson and nutrients foods  makes you a healthy behavior. But activity is maintained functional body organs and fitness free live lifelong. Although, I should accept the fact that  problem is more important in this case.

Some people feel supermarkets and manufacturers have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion

Essay:

A highly controversial issue today relates to whether industries or consumers should be responsible for the reduction in over wrapping of products displayed in stores. This essay will discuss both arguments and explain why I believe companies should make more efforts in boycotting excessive packaging. 

On the one hand, many producers manufacture commodities and put them in boxes as a means of attracting customers to buy their products. However, some of the materials that are used in making such packages are not eco-friendly and has led to the depletion of the ozone layers in recent years. For this reason, industries as a whole will benefit greatly from looking for environmentally friendly alternatives for their products. 

Conversely, buyers also play a role in saving the earth from harmful activities by stopping the purchase of items wrapped in large amount of plastic covering. This will result in the less demand for such item and it will directly limit manufacturing, thereby causing a decline in sales. For example, in Nigeria the massive reduction in the purchase of packaged meat from a particular meat vendor led to the company to invent jut bag for their meat sales. Moreover, customers can replace nylon packed groceries with re-usable shopping bags that are not dangerous to the environment.

In conclusion, although individuals have a role to play in the reduction of packaged consumable. I believe companies and shops have more responsibility in ensuring that their products are not detrimental to the ecosystem.

Many people decide on career path early on their lives and keep to it. This, they argue, leads to a more satisfying working life. To what extent do you agree with this view? What other things can people do in order to have satisfying working life?

Essay:

A number of employees may agree that constructing professional career early and staying on it is required as a way to acquire comfortable working routines. As a worker, I have same perspective with the earlier people's notion which will be detailed in the following paragraphs. Moreover, there will be another straightforward occasion which can be implemented in order to create enjoyable working circle.

To begin with, building an exceptional career early and focusing on it can create comfortable ecosystem inasmuch as they will have comprehensive understanding when they finish their daily routines. Based on that, workers can do their jobs exceptionally which will increase productivity. As a result, numerous compliments can be reached and production will be operated without any obstacles which can release satisfying in the internal circle of corporation. For example, I initiated my profession couple of years ago without altering corporation which gave satisfying condition.

Turning to another action, making sure that all duties in the company will fit with worker's background may gives a consequence that the employee will relish their responsibilities. For instance, I just selected the perfect profession based on my academic track as a way to make sure I could do my deskjobs excellently. Consequently, there was no enormous issue when I was a part of corporation previously and I always did my routines with cheerful condition. In other words, from the previous illustration, having tasks which are relevant with worker's credential can avoid massive problems later.

To conclude, I redeclare that having a supporting circle in our working life can be done by initiating professional record untimely and staying focus on it. In addition, an occasion such as fitting duties which will be done with our qualification is required to realize the earlier condition.

In the future, people may no longer be able to pay for things in shops using cash. All the payments may have to be made by card or using phones.

Do you think this will happen one day?

Why do you think some people might not be happy to give up using cash?

Essay:

With the evolution of technology, the use of credit/debit cards or phone transactions for payments is being preferred over  classic cash payments. Thanks to the pandemic in 2020, most people are opting for a cashless transaction.

As of today, the need to pay using cash has definitely been reduced. Some people prefer to pay using a card or UPI rather than carrying the entire wallet along with them. For example, there are a few street vendors who are also changing their business strategies and accepting other modes of payment as well. Even in the ,future only a half section of the population would prefer an online payment.

Answering the question of the crowd would completely avoid note payments for things, I partly disagree and partly agree with it. The reason for my disagreement is the survey conducted by the Times in 2021, 16% of the world's population lives in extreme poverty. It is extremely difficult for them to have proper shelter, food and medical access; let alone open a bank account. The only way for their mode of survival would be cash. Apart from the poverty factor, there are many folks who prefer to use currency because it gives them a sense of mindful spending rather than splurging.

I would agree that the currency might be totally avoided or banned and might start using cryptocurrencies. I personally feel, the greatest benefit would be to avoid using paper for printing notes, they can help the environment if we do not cut trees ,especially for paper.

There would definitely be a section of the crowd that most definitely wouldn't be happy about the use of online deposits as I have stated above regarding the mindful expenses, currency can be useful where there's a slow network or no connectivity to the Internet at all.

In conclusion, I would say notes and coins should remain in the picture and also the UPI mode of deposit, since the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.

In some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. Some people think that this is good for a country , while others believe government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn. Discuss both views and give your opinion

Essay:

A certain amount of the population is withdrawing handsome amounts of pay in several nations, some believe that this is a positive for that nation, while on the other hand, some argue that the government should act to restrict the amount to be paid to them. I fully endorse the first notion that earning high is prosperous for that nation, and instead of restricting their salaries government should encourage projects to foster more development and growth and should pave the way for others to earn higher, however, we would be discussing both the arguments below.

To begin with, a certain amount of the public  narrates that the authorities should restrict the amount being paid. This can be helpful ,especially in developing countries where the government can keep a check and balance on their people by curtailing down aspects such as money laundering through tax invasions  because this phenomenon is true to the extent that the elite class that earns more are involved in tax invasions, and that they are laundering their money illegally to buy assets in other parts of the globe. For instance, a report from the United Nations highlighted that the higher class in African and Asian countries have been buying assets in many parts of Europe through means of money laundering. This notion of limiting  pay can  also be useful to create harmony among the public so that the rich don't get richer and the poor don't get poorer. 

On the contrary, some perceive that this is beneficial for the government and their country. The government could benefit from the fact that their tax collection will increase, in ,particular they would have much more amount to spend on the general public. To simplify, they can use this income to start new development projects and invest more in areas where higher incomes can be generated. To illustrate, India has been growing rapidly due to the number of millionaires increasing in their society, hence, new projects of growth and development are being made available to the public. This argument can also encourage many others to earn more income and be successful in their lives. 

Furthermore, I believe that the government should promote more public to earn handsome amounts of pay and that this will benefit the country as a whole. In other words, high pay will help improve the living standards of many and the nation will have much more money from taxation to spend on prosperous projects such as IT schools and high-class hospitals. 

To conclude, regulating salaries might be helpful to restrict tax invasions but the overall government should motivate higher incomes as this could provide them with a sufficient amount of funds to increase development and growth.

Small Scale shopes are reducing in recent days ,talk about your opinion on this.
Essay:
In this contemporary era, the shops which run at a small level are declining at a rapid pace. I firmly opine that the basic cause of this trend is the establishment of  lavishing big stores as a way to flaunt  wealth. This put deleterious impacts on the income of small retailers and also becomes a hurdle for the public, who have the minimum capacity to spend.

To commence with, the major point of this deteriorating phenomenon which is earning level of small businessmen is going into vain. This is because the attractive hoardings of immense supermarkets influence the consumers as a consequence, no customer visits the little shops which badly affects their demand for the product. Moreover, the quality of goods  stops them to buy from small-scale shops. For instance, as per the survey conducted in America, it is believed by the majority of locals that giant malls are efficient due to the availability of distinct products such as clothes, groceries, food items, and accessories in one place. Thus, convenience is the factor leading to reduce sales in small markets.

Furthermore, another reason why people modify their choices is to show their status. This is because the big malls provide branded products which are considered quite fashionable and trendy instead of cheaper shop goods as people imitate their peers and visit the same shop which their mates do and utilize the huge amount in all things, only to maintain their sterling image which affects the portion of the community who cannot afford such expensive things.For example, a number of individuals with  credit card limits have to be suffered from losses due to overindulging towards big stores which creates an obstacle for them. Thus, small markets are the best way to purchase in large quantities at reasonable prices.

In conclusion, I think that although malls are beneficial for buying partywear clothes and things for special occasions, still small markets are helpful in various ways such as in saving income and maintaining the simple living of people.
