Topic:
"There have been major advances in technology over recent decades and this has led to significant improvements in people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Developments in technology in recent years has brought great impacts to the lives of individual in the society today. I strongly believe that the current positive changes in technology has improved people's lives. 

One of the main impact of technology on individual's lives is that, it  generate employment opportunities in different organizations. People who are computer literate have been able to be employed to various organizations like airports, companies, banks, and hospitals. All these organizations depend on technology in their day to day activities. For instance, computer experts have been able to be employed to places like bank and they make use of computer to store their data. Also, many medical practitioner have been considered for job opportunity because of their knowledge of computer. Secondly, development of technology improves level of communication. Many people from various places have been able to communicate maximally through the use of telephones, electronic mails and other social media handles. To illustrate, a  friend of mine was able to apply for a job inside her room, this application was sent via electronic mail and the organization replied back within two days of application. In addition, people have been able to reach out to one another through the use of telephone.

However, technology has helped to reduce the workload at home and also improved means of transportation.Household chores like washing clothes and plates, have been made easier by the use of washing machine. Cars, aeroplanes, ships and trains have serve as means of transportation for people and goods. For example, initially, I normally spend about three hours washing my clothes but with the help of technology, I have been able to use washing machine for washing clothes under thirty minutes. Furthermore I get to my place of work easily buy driving my car.

In summary, although there are a lot of benefits attached to the advent of technology but our daily activities should not be dependent on it."

Topic: 
"Multinational companies are becoming increasingly common in developing countries. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?"

Essay:
"It is becoming more popular in developing nations to see multinational corporations. There are some benefits for this trend such as the progress in the economy they create in these countries and the availability of jobs, however, the shut down of some small local businesses and the lower selling rate of local products can be its drawbacks.

The main advantage of the increasing number of these types of companies is the economic progress. That is to say, if multinational organizations operate in less-developed nations, this can bring wealth which boosts industries, trade, and other aspects of the economy. Moreover, more jobs will be available for the local people. That is because more workers and managers are needed to work for these companies which can be a good opportunity for locals to find a job. For instance, after opening a branch of Apple company in Dubai, many local graduates were thrilled by the good news of being accepted to work under this renowned company. 

However, one of the main disadvantages of this trend is the drop in the selling rate of the local products. That is because of the good reputations and qualities of international items, and, thus, citizens might refrain from buying their local products. Another disadvantage is that some small local shops could be closed. That is due to the unfair competition with these huge strong establishments, and as a result, some might be shut down or go bankrupt. For example, many amateur Syrian entrepreneurs, and after the harsh competition they had with international textile corporation, were forced to close their fabric factories. 

In conclusion, although the advantages of the popularity of multinational organizations in developing countries are the economic progress and the improvement in the job market, nonetheless, its downsides are the drop in the average selling of local products and the closure of some small businesses."

Topic: 
"Some people believe that allowing children to male their own choices on everyday matters(such as food, clothes and entertainment) is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes. Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion"

Essay:
"Many people think that parents should allow their children make daily decisions, but others are concerned that doing so can raise self-serving individuals. Personally, I believe that we should let them make the decision.

On the one hand, children grew by extremely strict parents tend to be social introverts. They had to obey all of their parents' rules as children, regardless of what they wanted to do. For instance, they might be particularly skilled in gaming or working with technology. However, their parents want them to become physicians or engineers. Since they are unable to pursue their own interests, they develop a lack of ambition. Therefore, it is crucial to allow kids make decisions or think about what they want to do from an early age.

On the other side, individuals who grew up with their parents in relatively open relationships frequently lack empathy for others. This occurs because they always received from their guardian what they want and did not have to consider if it was right or wrong. It is their parents' fault, not their own. Elders should teach kids whether or not they are being sensible so that they understand that things don't always go the way they do in movies. Because of this, it is also crucial to manage some of their early emotions.

My parents educated me and instilled in me the value of considering all possibilities and their effects before acting. Today, I developed into a person who can express my needs to others while also knowing what I really desire. Therefore, I think it is the parents' primary responsibility to always make sure their children are on the right track."

Topic: 
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?"

Essay:
"In some nations, there is an increasing number of homeowners who show interest in delving into the past of the house or building they reside in. This essay will look at some possible causes and offer  multiple ways to help residents investigate this.

Firstly, understanding the home’s history can help people to know whether they can or can’t alter parts of the building. If individuals are aware of the background of their houses, they will be provided with a better understanding of the condition including construction materials used or how the house evolved. This information, therefore, prevents owners from causing irreparable damage to original features. Secondly, many people look for the story of their homes because they are curious. To illustrate, some remnants such as a portrait of a family member, or some novels left by the previous occupants might trigger curiosity about who they were.

There are several methods which can enable people to find out about the history of where they live in. To begin with, they can look for the seniors in their neighbourhood to ask questions. These people have been living in the area for years and staying in touch with previous owners so they know a lot about what happens behind the walls. Hence, they can share things and provide the necessary information. In addition, census records are helpful for new homeowners. Thanks to these, individuals are able to discover the names of family members who lived in the home, as well as their marital status, occupations, and other intriguing information.

In conclusion, looking at the past of a property is essential if a person wants to make some changes to the house or to find the answer to unsure past events. In order to find the answer, residents can seek old people living in nearby areas or look up old census records."

Topic: 
"Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugars which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar."

Essay:
"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.

On the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.

 The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.

On the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.

 Moreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits.

In conclusion, it is probably a great idea to make the deserts and chocolates expensive as it can cut off the buyers but there are other practical measures that need to be taken which have a greater impact."
