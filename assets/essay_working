Topic: 
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?"

Essay:
"In some nations, there is an increasing number of homeowners who show interest in delving into the past of the house or building they reside in. This essay will look at some possible causes and offer  multiple ways to help residents investigate this.

Firstly, understanding the home’s history can help people to know whether they can or can’t alter parts of the building. If individuals are aware of the background of their houses, they will be provided with a better understanding of the condition including construction materials used or how the house evolved. This information, therefore, prevents owners from causing irreparable damage to original features. Secondly, many people look for the story of their homes because they are curious. To illustrate, some remnants such as a portrait of a family member, or some novels left by the previous occupants might trigger curiosity about who they were.

There are several methods which can enable people to find out about the history of where they live in. To begin with, they can look for the seniors in their neighbourhood to ask questions. These people have been living in the area for years and staying in touch with previous owners so they know a lot about what happens behind the walls. Hence, they can share things and provide the necessary information. In addition, census records are helpful for new homeowners. Thanks to these, individuals are able to discover the names of family members who lived in the home, as well as their marital status, occupations, and other intriguing information.

In conclusion, looking at the past of a property is essential if a person wants to make some changes to the house or to find the answer to unsure past events. In order to find the answer, residents can seek old people living in nearby areas or look up old census records."

Topic: 
"Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugars which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar."

Essay:
"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.

On the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.

 The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.

On the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.

 Moreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits.

In conclusion, it is probably a great idea to make the deserts and chocolates expensive as it can cut off the buyers but there are other practical measures that need to be taken which have a greater impact."

Topic: 
"Today’s schools should teach their students how to survive financially in the world today. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?"

Essay:
"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is teaching students how to be financially competent in the world. Now people are beginning to realize that schools need to add such clasess where children will be taught how to handle money. Personally, I tend to think think that it is a great opportunity for kids to become more informed and even succesfull. 

Firstly, it is well known that it is more convenient to teach people financial literacy from an early age because they convey information very easily. What I mean here is that they will know the value for funds and will be more accurate when purchasing something. One of the main reasons behind that is those kids will never complain about the lack of money because they had already broadened their horizons and know how to deal with distinct financial difficulties. A good case in point is children will be able to handle a salary for expensive things such as houses or cars which is the goal of every adult. 

On the other hand, it can also be argued that only this kind of lesson should be educated at schools. That is to say teachers should pay a lot of attention to other subjects because students have to obtain proper education not only how to be skilled at funding. Take for example, there are a wide range of kids who may not be interested in finance, so it is crucial to consider that fact and not to focus on only one aspect. 

In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account we can say that there are both pros and cons to this purpose, however, it would not be superfluous in the lives of young people, it can only provide the best future"

Topic: 
"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Humanity has always been experimenting with different technologies to make sales perform better. In recent years, online shopping websites and apps have become quite popular, which makes some individuals think that they can close down offline shops. In my opinion this claim is overstated and it is not going to happen in the near future. However, online services may be more preferable for certain people.

On the one hand, offline shops afford people the opportunity to make more deliberate and weighed decisions on items to buy. This is especially the case for clothes, as it is much more convenient to try on them immediately in a fitting room. Another significant benefit of offline shops is that a person can ask for a consultation from a seller. This is crucial for older individuals, who need extra guidance and assistance during their shopping. For instance, my grandparents are not advanced users of the internet, therefore they always choose to see products they want to buy with their own eyes.

On the other hand, online services have developed substantially over the recent years. They are constantly looking for new opportunities to make their apps and websites convenient to as many users as possible. The reason for that is the advanced improvement of internet technologies, which allows them to experiment with different styles of user interface to find the ones that perform better for everyone.

In conclusion, the majority of individuals use online services because of their convenience. However, there will always be people who find them difficult to use or simply enjoy the offline shopping experience. This is the reason why offline shops are going to coexist with online apps and websites making shopping available for all the people."

Topic: 
"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"In recent times we have had an increase in online shopping and certain individuals believe it will lead to the closure of shops in towns and cities. Although we have reasons to agree with this, I disagree with this notion and in this essay, I will state my reasons.

Firstly, online shopping has been helpful to a lot of people especially the working class who have limited time to visit the market. With this, they are able to stay in the comfort of their homes or office and place an order for most items on a website. Secondly, for items manufactured in a location far from the buyer, they can be ordered online and shipped to them. For example, we have goods produced in China or in Vietnam and they are displayed on a particular website and then can be purchased and shipped to the buyer's location in Nigeria.

On the other hand, we have a lot of fashion items that are better off bought in a physical store. Personally, I have purchased dresses and shoes online which were sent to me and were not my size. For example, I purchased a dress online in a large size but it was delivered as a medium-sized dress. As a result, I had to return the dress and incurred extra costs for shipping. Also, I bought a footwear on a website and it was delivered two sizes smaller than my size. This in turn can also lead to me wasting money as I end up giving the item out or I have to wait for so long to get it replaced. Another issue is with household utensils and perishable goods. Purchasing these items online is not favourable as they might get to the buyer damaged and in terrible conditions in the process of delivering the item. For example, an individual decides to order foodstuffs like tomatoes or glassware like mugs and plates online. In most cases, the tomatoes are delivered rotten, while the mugs and plates are delivered broken as a result of carelessness by the delivery man which can be avoided if an individual goes to personally purchase the items.

In conclusion, although online shopping is a great medium for obtaining goods and services, it can never lead to the closure of all stores in towns and cities as individuals avoid getting items they cannot use as a result of the wrong size and will have the luxury to pick from various design and check different stores."

Topic: 
"Giving detail information of Crime in newspaper and on television has bad consequences, some suggest that government should impose some restriction on them. What extent you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"It is sometimes argued that the huge popularity of violent information on social media can be attributed to harassment, thus, some data should be restricted. I completely agree with this statement.

First of all, in the era of globalization, People can get bombarded with numerous mass media which are reachable to everyone whether adults or adolescents. Thus, some harmful behaviours shown in criminal news can bring about crime in children or dangerous actions. For example, in the last 10 years, mass murders have increased because people, youth in particular, copy this threatening action from detailed information about a murder on television. Furthermore, by being published in public, severe images being normalized will allow children to view them as a common incident. For instance, in America, an abundance of pupils have been killed by their own schoolmates who try to imitate this hazardous behaviour from a computer game that they commonly take  every day.

Consequently, To tackle this problem, they should limit the age of certain dangerous news and censor harsh pictures, thus, these cruel mediums can be less and less accessible to youngsters. Moreover, citizens ought to be educated about data purification, hence, they will be able to distinguish what should be delivered by them. For example, the criminal process should no longer be shown in media because children will imitate this conduct, moreover, parents should counter this attack by controlling their kids when they are delivered messages from television.

To conclude, from my perspective, this statement is correct. to overcome this dangerous action, the government should keep the medium, newspapers and television, in particular, free of violation by limiting the detail."
