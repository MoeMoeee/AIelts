Topic:
"There have been major advances in technology over recent decades and this has led to significant improvements in people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Developments in technology in recent years has brought great impacts to the lives of individual in the society today. I strongly believe that the current positive changes in technology has improved people's lives. 

One of the main impact of technology on individual's lives is that, it  generate employment opportunities in different organizations. People who are computer literate have been able to be employed to various organizations like airports, companies, banks, and hospitals. All these organizations depend on technology in their day to day activities. For instance, computer experts have been able to be employed to places like bank and they make use of computer to store their data. Also, many medical practitioner have been considered for job opportunity because of their knowledge of computer. Secondly, development of technology improves level of communication. Many people from various places have been able to communicate maximally through the use of telephones, electronic mails and other social media handles. To illustrate, a  friend of mine was able to apply for a job inside her room, this application was sent via electronic mail and the organization replied back within two days of application. In addition, people have been able to reach out to one another through the use of telephone.

However, technology has helped to reduce the workload at home and also improved means of transportation.Household chores like washing clothes and plates, have been made easier by the use of washing machine. Cars, aeroplanes, ships and trains have serve as means of transportation for people and goods. For example, initially, I normally spend about three hours washing my clothes but with the help of technology, I have been able to use washing machine for washing clothes under thirty minutes. Furthermore I get to my place of work easily buy driving my car.

In summary, although there are a lot of benefits attached to the advent of technology but our daily activities should not be dependent on it."

"SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD STUDY WHATEVER THEY LIKE. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO STUDY SUBJECTS THAT WILL BE  USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
DISCUSS BOTH THESE VIEWS AND GIVE YOUR OPINION."

Essay:
"Some humans believe that students in tertiary institutions should have the right to study the courses they like. However, other people believe that they should offer courses that will be beneficial later in life

In this essay, I will analyze the points and present my view in favour of people who believe that students should be given the right to study the courses they like.

On one side, having a chance to study science and technology-related courses can bring many benefits. First of all, the world is evolving every day with the use of technology especially the health line. Most devices used in the hospital are implemented by technology talking about the intensive care unit. This helps in making work easy and also reduces the rate at which patients die. However, I still believe that students should be given the chance to study courses they like because not everyone has the ability to cope with science and technology-related courses and also studying their dream courses will benefit them and also the community at large just like those who studied science and technology related courses.

On the other side, Students can be better prepared for the career they like because more time will be spent on studying what they are interested in and also they will learn with more enthusiasm because they will learn what they like.

Personally, I think that some courses studied in  tertiary institutions aside from the science and technology-related courses are also well recognized because of their impact laid in  society. Talking about the lawyers and judges who give justice to situations. This has helped  society at large by making it a favourable atmosphere for us all to live in.When students are given the opportunity to study the courses they like it gives them the opportunity to extend their range of interest and also helps them develop important characteristics such as self-confidence, and high self-esteem because they were not forced to study courses they did not like."

"The arts, including art, music and theatre are considered to be important in society.

Do you think the arts still have a place amongst our modern lifestyles?

Should the arts be included in the school curriculum"

Essay:
"Nowadays, art cannot be apart from human life, while creativity is one aspect that is paramount to support our activities. Artists and entertainers need that skill in their job to entertain people. Thus, I believe art is an essential aspect of modern society and should be embraced in education from the first level to university life. 

To begin with, entertainment such as music and art gallery is indeed important for people to cope with stressful and pressure daily routine jobs because they will assist to make relax and be happy. Subsequently, art also has a place to create job opportunities for many young people due to it broadening job vacancy in creative sectors in a big city. Thus, arts still have a place in the current modern lifestyle.

On the other hand, education is of higher standard in a city and modern life necessity, although in the current situation, science and technology are merely more popular rather than art. In fact, art should be embedded in all curriculum subjects of study from primary school to university to encourage  creativity and have a good sense of their product-making, regardless of their educational background. For instance, when pupils add art sense to their creation to make the user interfaces of apps, it leads to eye-catching and colourful.

In conclusion, art cannot be imparted from current modern life as well as it should be attached to all levels of education from elementary to university. Therefore, I believe artistically is still massively needed since then to this era in making people enjoy and colourful life."

"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that governments of wealthy countries should take more obligation for assisting impoverished countries in such areas. Now people are beginning to realize that development depends on the joint efforts of a large number of different groups."

Essay:
"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that governments of wealthy countries should take more obligation for assisting impoverished countries in such areas. Now people are beginning to realize that development depends on the joint efforts of a large number of different groups. Personally, I tend to think that everyone should assist to each other in difficult times.

Firstly, it is well known that a large number of rich lands have an opportunity to help. What I mean here is that they are able to create distinct events in support of poor society. One of the main reasons behind that is they have a wide range of facilities due to this they may pool their resources and improve lives in impoverished countries. A good case in point is providing jobs for qualified people from economically backward nations, so both sides can obtain mutual benefit and strengthened their relations. 

On the other hand, it can also be argued that only rich countries must be responsible. That is to say poor nations should aim to become self-sufficient and do not attempt to rely on someone. Take for example, the situation with the COVID 19 pandemic, when the entire world was going through financial turmoil and needed assistance. Therefore, poor countries suffer enormously due to the lack of a competent economy and proper conditions for life so what they should do is consider every single detail in the development of the country to escape such terrible circumstances.

In conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account in our final analysis we can say that the optimum solution is to provide market access so the region can produce products and obtain regular income."

"Some people think that parents should teach their children how to be good members of society. Others, however, believe that school is the best place to learn this. Discuss both views and give your own opinion."

Essay:
"Some people believe that children should be taught by their parents about how to function as useful members of society, while others believe that sending children to educational institutions is the best way for them to study this. Although the latter opinion can be beneficial in some cases, I believe that family upbringing plays a more important role in educating children to be good parts of the community.

Schools can be considered suitable places for children to learn to be good citizens. With standardized educational methods, schools can foster childrenâ€™s cognitive development so that they are able to contribute to society in the future. For example, Trung Vuong school and Vinschool are well known for having nurtured successful alumni such as Professor Ngo Bao, Professor Nguyen Hung who have devoted their talents to the development of the country. However, these people only represent a small fraction of the total number of students attending schools, and thus sending children to schools cannot be the best method of educating them to be good members of society. 

I believe that parents play a more important role in teaching them how to be good citizens. In Vietnam, the average class size is 20 students, which makes it difficult for educators to provide proper schooling for each student. One to one lessons at home, on the other hand, allow children to progress faster. Furthermore, parents form stronger bonds with their offspring and thus, it is easier for them to shape childrenâ€™s personalities at an early age. For example, by telling stories such as Robin Hood, Cinderella before bedtime, parents can instil a sense of compassion and integrity into them. These children are likely to become good members of society when they grow up.

In conclusion, although sending children to schools can be seen as a way of teaching them how to be good citizens, I believe that domestic upbringing has a bigger impact on determining who they are in the future."

"There is an increasing trend around the world of married couples deciding not to have children. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for couples who decide to do this."

Essay:
"An increasing number of married couples around the world choosing to remain childless. The main benefits of not having a child for couples are that they can focus on their careers and have more time for themselves. The main drawbacks are that they could not fit into their peersâ€™ group and have no one to look after them when they get old. 

One primary advantage of remaining childless for married couples is that they can focus on their work. This is because they have less responsibility and distractions in their lives compared to the couples that have a child. Another advantage of this is that they have more spare time. Looking after a child is a full-time job for parents and taking most of their time, while child-free couples have lots of free time after work. For example, many couples stop going out late with their friends after having a child as they have to stay at home for looking after their children. 

One disadvantage of couples deciding not to have children is that they can struggle to hang with their peers after most of them have children. Most parents prefer to spend more time with other couples that have children as well. Moreover, do not have anyone to look after them in their elderliness is another disadvantage. Children are the ones who take care of their parents when they get old because their parents did the same for them when they were young. For instance, the vast majority of the people who live in care homes have no child. 

In conclusion, the main benefits of staying child-free for couples are that they can be more career-oriented and have more free time for themselves, and the main drawbacks are that they could have problems about fitting into their friendsâ€™ group and having no one to take care of them when they become older."

Essay:
"Some would say that parents should teach their offspring how to be good members of society, while others are of the opinion that school is the best in this regard. This essay agrees with the latter point and will show that, despite the practical experiences that parents give their children, school lessons can give deep insights into what it takes to be good citizens.

Some believe that parents can educate their children about being good members of society based on their life experiences. This is because the life experiences that parents can give their children are straightforward, down-to-earth, and so they can easily apply what their parents teach them in reality. For example, many children in Thailand become more polite, honest, and caring to everyone as a direct result of the practical lessons that their parents give them at home. However, I believe that parents now are so busy and do not spend much time with their children teaching them.

Lessons at school can provide children with valuable insights into being good members of society. In class, students can receive lessons about different traits of a truly good person that society needs, and then they put what they learn into practice by creating real-life problems and solving them together. For instance, after receiving lessons in civic education at school, many Vietnamese students are more willing to help their neighbors and even strangers, and they feel extremely happy after doing something good for others. For this reason, I believe that school lessons are more influential to young children. 

In conclusion, despite the practical experiences that parents can give their children at home, this essay believes that school lessons can help students deepen their understanding of being good members of society."
