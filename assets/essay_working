Topic: 
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?"

Essay:
"In some nations, there is an increasing number of homeowners who show interest in delving into the past of the house or building they reside in. This essay will look at some possible causes and offer  multiple ways to help residents investigate this.

Firstly, understanding the home’s history can help people to know whether they can or can’t alter parts of the building. If individuals are aware of the background of their houses, they will be provided with a better understanding of the condition including construction materials used or how the house evolved. This information, therefore, prevents owners from causing irreparable damage to original features. Secondly, many people look for the story of their homes because they are curious. To illustrate, some remnants such as a portrait of a family member, or some novels left by the previous occupants might trigger curiosity about who they were.

There are several methods which can enable people to find out about the history of where they live in. To begin with, they can look for the seniors in their neighbourhood to ask questions. These people have been living in the area for years and staying in touch with previous owners so they know a lot about what happens behind the walls. Hence, they can share things and provide the necessary information. In addition, census records are helpful for new homeowners. Thanks to these, individuals are able to discover the names of family members who lived in the home, as well as their marital status, occupations, and other intriguing information.

In conclusion, looking at the past of a property is essential if a person wants to make some changes to the house or to find the answer to unsure past events. In order to find the answer, residents can seek old people living in nearby areas or look up old census records."

Topic: 
"Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugars which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar."

Essay:
"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.

On the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.

 The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.

On the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.

 Moreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits.

In conclusion, it is probably a great idea to make the deserts and chocolates expensive as it can cut off the buyers but there are other practical measures that need to be taken which have a greater impact."

Topic: 
"Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion."

Essay:
"In today's world there are two opinions about whether or not it is beneficial to get a higher education at universities. Some tend to think that doing a degree is the best way to be a high-paid employee, whereas others' opinion is that hands-on learning and people skills are more essential. I will discuss both of these views and express my opinion .

There are groups of people who think that it is necessary to finish a university because without educational background there are fewer chances to get a good profession. University education provides a lot of courses that will teach students about important skills that will help them in their future job. On top of that, teachers are subject specialists and have excellent experiences which can be helpful for their learners. Therefore, some people think that completing a university education is a thing that should be done by students anyway.

Turning to the other side of the argument, others' view is that experience and soft skills are more pivotal than education at the university. The reason is that sometimes students can have a good education, but they do not know, for example, how to behave with people politely, they do not have an experience in answering correctly in different situations, such as when a customer does not like the thing that he has bought and get angry. Thus, people think that is more pivotal to get experience rather than education.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I tend to think that it is necessary for everyone to get a higher education because it provides a wide selection of opportunities for students."

Essay:
"curriculum is the vital part of education and it must be decided with extreme caution. Some people believe that sport subject are usless and not be the part of future curriculum; however, I argue that sports are crucial for a balanced life, so I disagree with notion that sports subjects may not the part of curriculm. This essay intends to discuss the importancde of sport in anyones life.

There are myriad advantages of sports curriculm as they significantly effect the health of human beings. For example, research in The United States proved that students who enrolled in a school with sports curriculm demonstrate more effective result as compared to those students who get admitted in traditional schools, thus, this example illustrates the importance of sports in ones life. Without such sport practices we may turn our new generations in robotics as they may not able to live lively without fears. 

Many advance nations know the importance of sport subjects and encourages their population to practice sports on daily basis by introducing the free sports clubs. For instance, Japan has introduuced various free sports clubs for schools where students practics and get mentally fresh, albeit a little tired, as a result they become more productive. 

Following this look, it is clear that sports play a significant role in human life; need arises that impiment sport curriculum should impliment as necessasity course in all instituations, thus, I hope for the beterment of humanbeing this may occour as soon as possible."

Topic: 
"The governments investment in art such as music and theatre is a waste of money, government must invest money on public service instead. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"The Authorities Investing in art is a normal and old way business in which the government invest more in public services but, recently public demand has become more essential than art.Therefore, I will agree that the authorities should divert the money to invest in public demand such as the construction of good Roads and the provision of good water supply being more important than craft.This shall be expatriates in the essay.

The Authorities should spend more money on social needs such as roads than art because not everyone loves art despite the fact that it has its own health benefits but having good roads superseded it. For ,example when one is sick and needs to access health care on time with good roads, Heath care services will be rendered without any complications But when the roads are bad the person's condition will  become worst along the journey and death might occur.

In addition to the above, governments should invest more in providing a good water supply.As we all know that water is a major requirement for man to survive on Earth, after getting access to water if, the water consumed is unhygienic it will jeopardize the person's health. Good drink results in a good community and state. For instance, when people are always getting sick due to the consumption of unhygienic drinks, the governments will not have peace of mind, and money will be wasted on drugs instead of achievements in well-being.moreso if care is not taken life will be lost.

Conclusively, in contrast to the Government's investment in the craft such as music and theatre rather than public service, I will agree that money should be diverted to public services like the construction of good roads and the provision of good water that will help to have a good developing environment."

Topic: 
"Some people think that schools should not test and grade students. Others think that grades are important. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion."

Essay:
"While some individuals believe that pupils should not be tested or given grades in educational institutions, others are convinced that learners cannot evade without a grading system. To my mind, while testing can be beneficial for various reasons, schools should make systemic improvements to allow children to study without feeling under pressure.

To begin with, students can assess their progress using standardized tests. The scale allows teachers and learners to see how a pupil is doing in relation to the rest of the class. Not only does this help college admissions committees assess who is ready for college-level academics, but it can also assist them in identifying students who require additional support. Furthermore, learners consider grades to be a reflection of their intelligence. They may feel proud of themselves if they get high grades through effort. The feeling of success will encourage students to study harder.

On the other hand, the grading system is a wholly unreliable source of metrics in school. Students will endeavor to meet requirements that help them to get a high score and less on learning. Therefore, educational institutions should abandon the grading system in order to give students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and not be afraid to make mistakes. For instance, schools in Europe create a welcoming atmosphere where students may experiment and cultivate a passion for learning that lasts a lifetime. Students can concentrate more on their academic growth and avoid being unduly concerned with getting high marks when they are under less pressure to succeed.

To sum up, the grading system is a credible standard that encourages students to improve their academic performance. However, it may not accurately reflect the learner's knowledge; therefore, schools with reduced focus on grades encourage students to study without overdependence on high scores."
