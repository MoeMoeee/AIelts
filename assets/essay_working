"Some people think it's better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it's good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them. Discuss both the views and give your opinion."

Essay:
"Friendship is the only unconditional relationship in people's life as they are not obliged towards each other but still can rely on one another. Many argued that people should make friends with those, who have similar views, while others opine that people who have different opinions or do not always agree will be  good friends. I will articulate both  notions with a plausible explanation prior to giving my opinion.

On the one hand, People believe that having friends with the same thought process is better because they can be a good companions and will have a better understanding. In other words, when two persons with the same ideas and thoughts become friends, they can help each other to achieve their goals and there will be very less chances of conflicts. 

On the other hand, some individuals opine that friends with different opinions will be good because, it is very important to have someone in life who can tell an individual truth with compassion, without any fear of losing a friend. Moreover, this kind of friendship also aids in get  success in life as they can provide different perspectives towards problems to each other. Besides this, they get an opportunity to learn new things from one another experiences.

To conclude, in my ,opinion both kinds of friends have their own role in an individual's life. Friends with the same view are easy to get along with and with different opinions will get a different vision to look towards things."

"There have been major advances in technology over recent decades and this has led to significant improvements in people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"Developments in technology in recent years has brought great impacts to the lives of individual in the society today. I strongly believe that the current positive changes in technology has improved people's lives. 

One of the main impact of technology on individual's lives is that, it  generate employment opportunities in different organizations. People who are computer literate have been able to be employed to various organizations like airports, companies, banks, and hospitals. All these organizations depend on technology in their day to day activities. For instance, computer experts have been able to be employed to places like bank and they make use of computer to store their data. Also, many medical practitioner have been considered for job opportunity because of their knowledge of computer. Secondly, development of technology improves level of communication. Many people from various places have been able to communicate maximally through the use of telephones, electronic mails and other social media handles. To illustrate, a  friend of mine was able to apply for a job inside her room, this application was sent via electronic mail and the organization replied back within two days of application. In addition, people have been able to reach out to one another through the use of telephone.

However, technology has helped to reduce the workload at home and also improved means of transportation.Household chores like washing clothes and plates, have been made easier by the use of washing machine. Cars, aeroplanes, ships and trains have serve as means of transportation for people and goods. For example, initially, I normally spend about three hours washing my clothes but with the help of technology, I have been able to use washing machine for washing clothes under thirty minutes. Furthermore I get to my place of work easily buy driving my car.

In summary, although there are a lot of benefits attached to the advent of technology but our daily activities should not be dependent on it."

Topic:
"SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD STUDY WHATEVER THEY LIKE. OTHERS BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED TO STUDY SUBJECTS THAT WILL BE  USEFUL IN THE FUTURE, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.
DISCUSS BOTH THESE VIEWS AND GIVE YOUR OPINION."

Essay:
"Some humans believe that students in tertiary institutions should have the right to study the courses they like. However, other people believe that they should offer courses that will be beneficial later in life

In this essay, I will analyze the points and present my view in favour of people who believe that students should be given the right to study the courses they like.

On one side, having a chance to study science and technology-related courses can bring many benefits. First of all, the world is evolving every day with the use of technology especially the health line. Most devices used in the hospital are implemented by technology talking about the intensive care unit. This helps in making work easy and also reduces the rate at which patients die. However, I still believe that students should be given the chance to study courses they like because not everyone has the ability to cope with science and technology-related courses and also studying their dream courses will benefit them and also the community at large just like those who studied science and technology related courses.

On the other side, Students can be better prepared for the career they like because more time will be spent on studying what they are interested in and also they will learn with more enthusiasm because they will learn what they like.

Personally, I think that some courses studied in  tertiary institutions aside from the science and technology-related courses are also well recognized because of their impact laid in  society. Talking about the lawyers and judges who give justice to situations. This has helped  society at large by making it a favourable atmosphere for us all to live in.When students are given the opportunity to study the courses they like it gives them the opportunity to extend their range of interest and also helps them develop important characteristics such as self-confidence, and high self-esteem because they were not forced to study courses they did not like."

"The arts, including art, music and theatre are considered to be important in society.

Do you think the arts still have a place amongst our modern lifestyles?

Should the arts be included in the school curriculum"

Essay:
"Nowadays, art cannot be apart from human life, while creativity is one aspect that is paramount to support our activities. Artists and entertainers need that skill in their job to entertain people. Thus, I believe art is an essential aspect of modern society and should be embraced in education from the first level to university life. 

To begin with, entertainment such as music and art gallery is indeed important for people to cope with stressful and pressure daily routine jobs because they will assist to make relax and be happy. Subsequently, art also has a place to create job opportunities for many young people due to it broadening job vacancy in creative sectors in a big city. Thus, arts still have a place in the current modern lifestyle.

On the other hand, education is of higher standard in a city and modern life necessity, although in the current situation, science and technology are merely more popular rather than art. In fact, art should be embedded in all curriculum subjects of study from primary school to university to encourage  creativity and have a good sense of their product-making, regardless of their educational background. For instance, when pupils add art sense to their creation to make the user interfaces of apps, it leads to eye-catching and colourful.

In conclusion, art cannot be imparted from current modern life as well as it should be attached to all levels of education from elementary to university. Therefore, I believe artistically is still massively needed since then to this era in making people enjoy and colourful life."
