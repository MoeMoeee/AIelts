Topic: 
"The governments investment in art such as music and theatre is a waste of money, government must invest money on public service instead. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"The Authorities Investing in art is a normal and old way business in which the government invest more in public services but, recently public demand has become more essential than art.Therefore, I will agree that the authorities should divert the money to invest in public demand such as the construction of good Roads and the provision of good water supply being more important than craft.This shall be expatriates in the essay.

The Authorities should spend more money on social needs such as roads than art because not everyone loves art despite the fact that it has its own health benefits but having good roads superseded it. For ,example when one is sick and needs to access health care on time with good roads, Heath care services will be rendered without any complications But when the roads are bad the person's condition will  become worst along the journey and death might occur.

In addition to the above, governments should invest more in providing a good water supply.As we all know that water is a major requirement for man to survive on Earth, after getting access to water if, the water consumed is unhygienic it will jeopardize the person's health. Good drink results in a good community and state. For instance, when people are always getting sick due to the consumption of unhygienic drinks, the governments will not have peace of mind, and money will be wasted on drugs instead of achievements in well-being.moreso if care is not taken life will be lost.

Conclusively, in contrast to the Government's investment in the craft such as music and theatre rather than public service, I will agree that money should be diverted to public services like the construction of good roads and the provision of good water that will help to have a good developing environment."

Topic: 
"Some people think that schools should not test and grade students. Others think that grades are important. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion."

Essay:
"While some individuals believe that pupils should not be tested or given grades in educational institutions, others are convinced that learners cannot evade without a grading system. To my mind, while testing can be beneficial for various reasons, schools should make systemic improvements to allow children to study without feeling under pressure.

To begin with, students can assess their progress using standardized tests. The scale allows teachers and learners to see how a pupil is doing in relation to the rest of the class. Not only does this help college admissions committees assess who is ready for college-level academics, but it can also assist them in identifying students who require additional support. Furthermore, learners consider grades to be a reflection of their intelligence. They may feel proud of themselves if they get high grades through effort. The feeling of success will encourage students to study harder.

On the other hand, the grading system is a wholly unreliable source of metrics in school. Students will endeavor to meet requirements that help them to get a high score and less on learning. Therefore, educational institutions should abandon the grading system in order to give students the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and not be afraid to make mistakes. For instance, schools in Europe create a welcoming atmosphere where students may experiment and cultivate a passion for learning that lasts a lifetime. Students can concentrate more on their academic growth and avoid being unduly concerned with getting high marks when they are under less pressure to succeed.

To sum up, the grading system is a credible standard that encourages students to improve their academic performance. However, it may not accurately reflect the learner's knowledge; therefore, schools with reduced focus on grades encourage students to study without overdependence on high scores."
