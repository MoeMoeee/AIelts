Topic: 
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?"

Essay:
"In some nations, there is an increasing number of homeowners who show interest in delving into the past of the house or building they reside in. This essay will look at some possible causes and offer  multiple ways to help residents investigate this.

Firstly, understanding the home’s history can help people to know whether they can or can’t alter parts of the building. If individuals are aware of the background of their houses, they will be provided with a better understanding of the condition including construction materials used or how the house evolved. This information, therefore, prevents owners from causing irreparable damage to original features. Secondly, many people look for the story of their homes because they are curious. To illustrate, some remnants such as a portrait of a family member, or some novels left by the previous occupants might trigger curiosity about who they were.

There are several methods which can enable people to find out about the history of where they live in. To begin with, they can look for the seniors in their neighbourhood to ask questions. These people have been living in the area for years and staying in touch with previous owners so they know a lot about what happens behind the walls. Hence, they can share things and provide the necessary information. In addition, census records are helpful for new homeowners. Thanks to these, individuals are able to discover the names of family members who lived in the home, as well as their marital status, occupations, and other intriguing information.

In conclusion, looking at the past of a property is essential if a person wants to make some changes to the house or to find the answer to unsure past events. In order to find the answer, residents can seek old people living in nearby areas or look up old census records."

Topic: 
"Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugars which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar."

Essay:
"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.

On the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.

 The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.

On the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.

 Moreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits.

In conclusion, it is probably a great idea to make the deserts and chocolates expensive as it can cut off the buyers but there are other practical measures that need to be taken which have a greater impact."

Topic: 
"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Do you agree or disagree?"

Essay:
"In recent times we have had an increase in online shopping and certain individuals believe it will lead to the closure of shops in towns and cities. Although we have reasons to agree with this, I disagree with this notion and in this essay, I will state my reasons.

Firstly, online shopping has been helpful to a lot of people especially the working class who have limited time to visit the market. With this, they are able to stay in the comfort of their homes or office and place an order for most items on a website. Secondly, for items manufactured in a location far from the buyer, they can be ordered online and shipped to them. For example, we have goods produced in China or in Vietnam and they are displayed on a particular website and then can be purchased and shipped to the buyer's location in Nigeria.

On the other hand, we have a lot of fashion items that are better off bought in a physical store. Personally, I have purchased dresses and shoes online which were sent to me and were not my size. For example, I purchased a dress online in a large size but it was delivered as a medium-sized dress. As a result, I had to return the dress and incurred extra costs for shipping. Also, I bought a footwear on a website and it was delivered two sizes smaller than my size. This in turn can also lead to me wasting money as I end up giving the item out or I have to wait for so long to get it replaced. Another issue is with household utensils and perishable goods. Purchasing these items online is not favourable as they might get to the buyer damaged and in terrible conditions in the process of delivering the item. For example, an individual decides to order foodstuffs like tomatoes or glassware like mugs and plates online. In most cases, the tomatoes are delivered rotten, while the mugs and plates are delivered broken as a result of carelessness by the delivery man which can be avoided if an individual goes to personally purchase the items.

In conclusion, although online shopping is a great medium for obtaining goods and services, it can never lead to the closure of all stores in towns and cities as individuals avoid getting items they cannot use as a result of the wrong size and will have the luxury to pick from various design and check different stores."
