Topic:
"Some people think it's better to choose friends who always have the same opinions as them. Other people believe it's good to have friends who sometimes disagree with them. Discuss both the views and give your opinion."

Essay:
"Friendship is the only unconditional relationship in people's life as they are not obliged towards each other but still can rely on one another. Many argued that people should make friends with those, who have similar views, while others opine that people who have different opinions or do not always agree will be  good friends. I will articulate both  notions with a plausible explanation prior to giving my opinion"

Revised:
"Friendship is an unconditional relationship in which people rely on each other. While some believe that it's better to have friends with similar opinions, others argue that it's beneficial to have friends with differing views. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives before sharing my own opinion. On the one hand, some people believe that befriending individuals who share their opinions is advantageous. When two people with similar thoughts become friends, they can support each other in achieving their goals and are less likely to experience conflicts. This understanding leads to a stronger bond between the friends and helps them to overcome life's challenges together. On the other hand, others believe that having friends who disagree with them is beneficial. This type of friendship enables individuals to receive constructive criticism from someone they trust without the fear of losing a friend. Such friendships also offer a different perspective on life's problems, which can help individuals grow and broaden their horizons. Additionally, they can learn new things from each other's experiences, making the friendship mutually beneficial. In conclusion, both types of friendships have their own role in an individual's life. While friendships with similar views lead to a better understanding and can help achieve goals, friendships with differing views offer constructive criticism, different perspectives, and opportunities for personal growth. Therefore, it's important to have a balance of both types of friendships."
