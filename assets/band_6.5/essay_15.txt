Topic:
"Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugars which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar."

Essay:
"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.

On the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.

 The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.

On the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.

Moreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits."

Revised:
The preference for food has undergone significant changes over time, with high-sugar products gaining popularity despite their potential health risks. While some argue that increasing the price of sugary food and drinks would discourage their consumption, I believe that relying solely on higher costs is not the ideal solution. This essay will discuss the effectiveness of making sugary products more expensive and highlight the importance of raising awareness about their detrimental health effects. Additionally, alternative healthier options should be promoted.

One plausible approach to discourage the consumption of sugary products is by increasing their cost. When these items become expensive, individuals may hesitate to purchase them, leading to a decline in the market demand. For instance, if the price of popular soft drinks like Coca-Cola rises significantly and affordable alternatives are scarce, people are more likely to opt for healthier options due to financial considerations. Consequently, this strategy can foster a healthier and more affordable lifestyle.

While raising the price of sugary products may be effective, it should be complemented with comprehensive awareness campaigns. Educating the public about the adverse health consequences associated with excessive sugar intake is crucial. Supermarkets, for example, can organize campaigns to inform consumers about the rising prevalence of diseases such as diabetes, which can be attributed, in part, to high sugar consumption. By enhancing public knowledge regarding the negative effects of sugary drinks and foods, people are more likely to make informed decisions and reduce their consumption.

In addition to awareness campaigns, it is important to highlight and promote healthier alternatives to sugary products. By introducing people to natural sources of sweetness, such as fruits, they can satisfy their cravings for sweetness without resorting to high-sugar options. This approach not only contributes to a healthier lifestyle but also expands individuals' food choices and encourages a diversified diet.

In conclusion, while increasing the price of desserts and sugary treats may discourage some buyers, it is not the sole solution to reducing sugar consumption. Raising awareness about the health risks associated with excessive sugar intake and promoting healthier alternatives are equally crucial. By adopting a multifaceted approach that includes price adjustment, educational campaigns, and the promotion of healthier options, society can make significant strides towards reducing the consumption of high-sugar products.

Task Response: 6.5
Lack of clear opinion: While you mention that increasing the price of sugary products is not the only ideal solution, your essay does not explicitly state your opinion on whether sugary products should be made more expensive or not. In order to fully meet the task requirements, it is important to clearly express your position in the introduction and present a balanced discussion throughout the essay.
Insufficient development of the counterargument: Although you mention that there are other practical measures that need to be taken, you do not expand on these alternative solutions in detail. To improve your Task Response score, it is important to provide a thorough discussion of these other measures, including specific examples and supporting evidence.
Limited discussion of the impact of price increase: While you briefly discuss the potential impact of increasing the price of sugary products on consumer behavior, your essay could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the effects of price on consumption patterns. Consider discussing potential drawbacks or limitations of relying solely on price as a deterrent and how it may impact different socioeconomic groups.

Coherence and Cohesion: 6.0
Introduction: Your introduction provides a general overview of the topic but lacks a clear thesis statement that states your opinion. It is important to clearly present your stance on the issue in order to provide a clear roadmap for the essay.
Paragraph development: While your essay contains three body paragraphs, the development of ideas within each paragraph could be strengthened. Each paragraph should have a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting details and examples. Make sure to use cohesive devices such as linking words (e.g., "furthermore," "however," "in addition") to connect ideas and create a logical flow.
Transition between paragraphs: The transition between your second and third body paragraphs could be smoother. Consider using transitional phrases to connect the ideas and create a clear progression of thoughts.
Conclusion: Your conclusion summarizes the main points but does not provide a strong closing statement. Aim to end your essay with a concise restatement of your opinion and a concluding thought that reinforces your argument.

Repetition of vocabulary: In some instances, you rely on the same vocabulary repeatedly, which can make your writing sound repetitive and less varied. Try to use synonyms or related terms to avoid repetition and showcase a wider range of vocabulary.
Use of less common vocabulary: While your essay includes some appropriate vocabulary, there is room for incorporating more advanced or sophisticated words and phrases. This can enhance the overall quality of your writing and demonstrate a higher level of language proficiency.

Collocations and idiomatic expressions: Utilizing collocations (words that naturally go together) and idiomatic expressions can further enhance your lexical resource. These phrases can add depth and precision to your writing. For example, instead of saying "adverse consequences," you could use "negative ramifications" or "detrimental effects."
Word choice accuracy: While your word choice is generally appropriate, there are a few instances where more precise or contextually fitting words could be used. Be mindful of selecting words that accurately convey your intended meaning and align with the context of the sentence.
