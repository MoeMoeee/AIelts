Essay:

"As a human being who wants to get fit from time to time, sports play a big role to make us healthy. There are numerous type of sports in this world, yet, it can be divided into two sections, individual and team sports. While there are still debates over which type is better, here I would like to describe my views on both types and choose which one is better. 

Swimming, tennis, or even running are several sports that consider as individual sports. In this type of sports, our success is highly dependent on our performance and determination to achieve our goals. If the athletes want to be the winner, they must train harder than anyone else and set the goal as high as they can. Our achievements are not relying on outside factors. For example, Usain Bolt as a runner from Jamaica, always comes to the training earlier and trains as hard as he could. Therefore he achieves several medals at the Olympics. 

On the other hand, team sports such as basketball and football  count heavily on teamwork. Even though each individual has tremendous skills, if they cannot work as a team, their team will fail. As social creatures, human cannot life on their own, our life will be depends on someone. Therefore, teamwork will be one of the key for us to survive not only in sports, but also in our entire life. 

To summarize, both individual and team sports have their own benefits, however, to achieve more in sports and also in our life, I rather to choose team sports.

Revised:

Sports play an important role in keeping humans healthy and fit. While there are numerous types of sports, they can be broadly categorized into individual and team sports. Some people believe that playing team sports like football is more beneficial, while others argue that individual sports like tennis and swimming are better. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of sports and state my opinion on which one is better.

Individual sports such as swimming, tennis, and running depend on an athlete's performance and determination to achieve their goals. Success in individual sports is not dependent on external factors. For example, Usain Bolt, a Jamaican runner, won multiple medals in the Olympics by training harder than anyone else and setting high goals for himself.

Team sports like basketball and football rely heavily on teamwork. While individual skills are essential, the success of the team depends on how well the team members work together. As social creatures, human beings cannot survive on their own, and teamwork is crucial not only in sports but also in life.

In conclusion, whether an individual prefers to play individual or team sports is a personal choice. However, it is essential to recognize the benefits and drawbacks of both types of sports. While individual sports provide an excellent opportunity to develop personal skills and determination, team sports foster social and communication skills that are more valuable in the long run.


Feedback:

Task Response:?

Overall, your essay addresses the given topic appropriately and discusses both perspectives on whether team sports or individual sports are more beneficial. You have presented your own opinion in the conclusion. However, there are some areas that could be improved to enhance the task response.

Firstly, while you have mentioned the advantages of individual sports, such as personal skills and determination, you could have provided more examples or evidence to support your points. For instance, you could have mentioned the mental discipline required in individual sports and how it can translate into other areas of life.

Secondly, although you have briefly touched on the benefits of teamwork in team sports, you could have expanded on this aspect. Providing specific examples or explaining how teamwork skills acquired in sports can be applied in different life situations would have strengthened your argument. Additionally, you could have highlighted the importance of collaboration and communication in team sports.

Furthermore, to improve your task response, you could have discussed the potential drawbacks of each type of sport. For instance, individual sports may lack the social interaction and camaraderie inherent in team sports, while team sports may have more competition for a spot on the team or rely heavily on the performance of others.

To enhance the task response, it would have been helpful to include a clearer comparison of the benefits and drawbacks of both types of sports. You could have discussed the physical, mental, and social aspects of each and stated which type of sport you believe is more beneficial overall.

To summarize, while your essay does address the topic and provides some arguments for both team and individual sports, there is room for improvement. Expanding on the advantages and disadvantages of each type of sport, providing specific examples and evidence, and offering a more in-depth comparison would enhance the task response and strengthen your arguments.

Grammatical Range and Accuracy:?

Overall, the grammatical range and accuracy in your essay are fairly good. However, there are a few errors that I can point out:

1. "...it can be divided into two sections, individual and team sports." - Instead of using the word "sections," it would be more appropriate to use "categories" or "types" to refer to individual and team sports.

2. "...here I would like to describe my views on both types and choose which one is better." - This sentence could be rephrased to make it clearer and more concise. For example, you could say, "In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of sports and state my opinion on which one is better."

3. "Swimming, tennis, or even running are several sports that consider as individual sports." - This sentence should be rephrased for clarity. You could say, "Individual sports such as swimming, tennis, and running..."

4. "If the athletes want to be the winner..." - Instead of using "the winner," it would be more appropriate to use "a winner" or "winners" here.

5. "Our achievements are not relying on outside factors." - This sentence should be rephrased to make it grammatically correct. For example, you could say, "Our achievements do not rely on outside factors."

6. "As social creatures, human cannot life on their own..." - There is a grammatical error here. It should be "As social creatures, humans cannot live on their own..."

7. "To summarize, both individual and team sports have their own benefits, however, to achieve more in sports and also in our life, I rather choose team sports." - This sentence could be rephrased to improve clarity and accuracy. For example, you could say, "In conclusion, while both individual and team sports have their own benefits, I believe that choosing team sports can lead to greater achievements in both sports and life."

These are minor errors and do not significantly affect the readability or comprehension of your essay. Good job overall!
