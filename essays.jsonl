Others argue that it is more important for schools to give prizes for other achievements (for example, for sports, music and behaviour).

Therefore, a group of community believes that school heads should grant their students due to their academic results, while others insist on the importance of honour for other achievements on focusing to talent. Personally, I agree with the both ideas and this essay wil discuss my point of view in the following paragraphs, including some examples from my own experience.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, it is argued that school-goers should be assigned for their scholastic successes, such as international owlypia, steam olympiads, semi-final and final scores and etc. By awarding them, teachers, may create enthusiasm towards diligency, as well as it increases rivalry among youngsters. For instance, in 2015 when I was studying at 3rd grade of university, the government set an scholarship, about being able to study one year in London, for winning in the competition with other university. Almost 80% of faculties had participated in the competition willingly. Therefore, adolescents may be encouraged to get hang of their lessons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being talented in the various fields, such as sport, music, behaviour, should be appreciated, respectively. It is undeniable that, a gifted musician or sportsman may represent his or her country in the international arenas. To illlustrate, last month, 7 students of our lyceum which I work, had brought 7 gold, 5 silver medals from judo competition, organized in France, to our country. The founder of lyceum had organized honours ceremony and accordad all the participants because of their initiatives. I believe that the number of competitors, who wants to take part in the international games, will have been increased. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, with all of the examples that I have listed above, I believe that teenagers should be rewarded due to their personal ability, with the aim of creating favoured environment to show capacity."}

In addition, we can also post some interesting texts and videos on social software such as Weibo, TikTok, etc. These contents are public, if there are people who are interested in these contents, they will naturally comment on them, so that we will always meet a lot of like-minded people.In addition Social software can help people to know the world faster, because of its large information content and fast update speed, you can know the latest events of the world in a few seconds, such as some aviation news or the latest hot news about the entertainment circle. This can help people make the right judgment, know what is right and what is not right, and prevent going astray.\r\n\r\nDespite these benefits, I still believe that it has a lot of negative impacts.Firstly,False fraud information is numerous and easy to spread. Because now with the promotion of the Internet, all kinds of network fraud emerge  endlessly, so that you are impossible to guard against. Among them, the fraud methods lurking in the major social software, such as some issuing false advertisements in various groups and broadcasting false information on major live platforms. Those people use various means to infiltrate the major social software. People are going to lose a lot of money to these new scams.In addition, secondly, Social media has a lot to do with people's mental health, because studies have found a correlation between social media use and psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. People may be subjected to online violence because of some photos or videos posted on social media, they will evaluate and ridicule a person by height, or appearance. which will cause mental illness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that social media can let us know about the world and make more new friends, but I still believe that social media can also let us be cheated or make us psychologically hurt or even astray."}

What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?", "content": "One of the heated issues is there are less students following science-related subjects in university. Many people think that this situation cannot cause any negative effects. However, I do believe that the lack of science students might cause severe consequences on society. In this essay, I will give my own opinion on the reasons and causes of the shortage of science students.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the number of students choosing science has decreased dramatically in recent years. There are many reasons for this. For one thing, many undergraduates found science-related subjects difficult and not attractive enough. For another, science subjects taught in the current educational program are so impractical that undergraduates cannot apply what they learn in real life situations. The most familiar example of this is that Vietnamese students have to learn a lot of unrealistic knowledge that cannot help them much in their work. On the other hand, many students having a great passion for science may not have enough money to pay because of the high  educational fee in university. It seems quite clear that these factors have a significant contribution to the decrease of science students.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the shortage of undergraduates learning science may cause extreme effects on society. As many students found science unattractive, students can easily get bored of science. The science subjects boredom is the main reason for the lack of science students which can lead to the shortage of science workers in the future. Take Vietnam for an example, if this situation keeps continuing, Vietnamese patients will have struggled with the decrease in the number of doctors in 50 years\u2019 time. To address this problem, the Vietnamese government has worked out many measures to attract more students to choose to study science at university. In a nutshell, this problem must be tackled quickly. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the decline in science-related  subjects students can cause terrible effects. Both governments and their citizens have to take action to address this constructively."}

To what extent do you agree with this?", "content": "Nowadays, education institutions utilize various methods in teaching such as books, films, and computers. Although these modern techniques like videos and snaps are effective, I do not agree that we should replace books with it. In this essay, I will elaborate on my viewpoint with relevant examples. \r\n\r\nFirstly, this is undeniable that these facilities bring benefits for students and teachers, and make the education process more flexible. For instance, tutors could create practical examples of the materials they teach by using videos or by showing short movies, in addition, it enhances learners' understanding of some complicated curriculums or difficult subjects such as Geography and Geology. Therefore we can say that these methods are proven to be sophisticated and have an overwhelming endorsement particularly in developed countries such as America and Europe. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, book is the tradional way of studying for ages. It plays an indispensable role in forming students' awareness, it is the first and foremost tool in teaching. For example, in developing countries where technology is expensive or not available, book is the only tool to use in teaching, thus we cannot deny its significant importance. In addition, it attracts young learners who are captivated by colorful photos and stories written in books, moreover, those who have a reading hobby would find books attractive instead of videos and films.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although using books in teaching sometimes sounds tedious and time-consuming, we can not replace it with other techniques, furthermore, films, TV, and computer are not available many places over the globe."}

Whereas there is somebody who opines that as these types of products become overpriced, the number of individuals who will purchase these goods will decrease, I wholeheartedly disagree with this conviction based on some compelling reasons which will be discuss in detail. \r\n\r\nThe first reason why I disagree is that this policy does not seem sensible and logical due to this fact that who can warrant that if the prices of these kinds of industrial products have been rose, all of the citizens will decide to cut out on sugary edible things. Other probable attitudes that can be seen toward the increase in the cost of sugary processed foods should be noticed. For example, it is possible that someone, who loves these things, eliminates some healthy items from their daily food basket unit they could afford their desired snacks or meals or stop paying for doing excercise in a gym or other places to be able to buy these products and these decisions are more dangerous for their health condition.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that I disagree is that not only are not all of the industrial edible items that contain different types of sugar unhealthy but also some of them such as carbohydrates play a vital role in body function and are considered as the most important source of energy for human bodies. If the price of these products such as rice or pasta rocket up, deprived dwellers will become poorer and weaker in purchasing these things and perhaps confront seriouse and irreparable issues in the health field. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, somebody firmly believes that if sugary industrial products have been rose, the tendency of people to buy them will decrease. From my perspective, this idea does not seem a constructive and effective solution to reduce the consumption of these things that sometimes are considered  unhealthy foods and we have to seek another remedy for this problem."}

While hasty decisions can lead to regrets and failures, embracing risks is necessary for progress and development. Though some fear losing what they have, the advantages of taking risks often outweigh the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, risks entail uncertainty, and missteps can result in adverse consequences, potentially harming relationships and overall well-being. However, learning from negative experiences and setbacks can provide valuable life lessons and foster personal growth. By using these lessons to their advantage, individuals can progress in their careers and improve the quality of their lives.\r\n\r\nSuccessful people, especially entrepreneurs and innovators, are often characterized by their willingness to take risks and embrace failures as stepping stones toward eventual success. The journey of advancement frequently requires leaps of faith and the courage to face the unknown. For many, the path to success is paved with challenges and potential setbacks, but it is these very risks that can lead to remarkable achievements.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while risks can be perilous, their potential benefits make them an integral part of life's journey.

Therefore, it is not surprising that a lot of people own private cars in order to get to their work on exact time, as it is really useful to cover the miles in a short amount of time. As a result, it leads to traffic flows on roads and quarrels between furious drivers who may have serious duties related to their businesses.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this kind of issue, the government of each country ought to plan and construct roads and highways of high quality both in new industrial centres and rural areas.

Personally, I strongly believe that this kind of action ought to be taken in most cities, as it has plenty of benefits for both citizens and environment.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, forbidding the use of private vehicles in certain city areas definitely has numerous advantages for environment. In other words, people can reduce the number of problems related to the pollution of environment by simply stopping driving personal cars that emit gases and other pollutants. For example, in Germany, individuals use public transportation to get to work or school instead of owning automobiles that affect on the surroundings. Furthermore, there are a lot of posters and advertisements that aware visitors and travelers not to smoke in forests, and so on. Tht is why, the ambience there is very pure and neat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is rather complicated for people who have families and work around the clock. As far as I know, most parents needed personal automobiles to get their children to school or education centres safely, to be confident in their safety. Moreover, some employees who have plenty of duties, such as meetings and business around a town, would not be able to get somewhere they want on time, as it really time-consuming because of public transports which have a certain schedule.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I fully agree that this kind of measure should be followed in other cities, as it really benefits in protecting the surrroundings and habitat there."}

First of all, people start a business  they will be an improved reputation with their customers. If the business had had public responsibilities, it would have made more money.

What damage does plastic do to the environment? What can be done by governments and individuals to solve this problem?", "content": "These days the items made of the plastic such as bottles and packaging are becoming a huge threat to our environment. These non biodegradable materials have detrimental effects on the fertility of soil and purity of air as well as water. Authorities and people should take stern steps like banning the use and manufacturing of plastic items as well as implementing the concept of reduce and reuse.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the prime damaging effect of plastic on our surroundings is that it reduces the productivity of soil. Being a water resistant material, plastic prevents the rain water from seeping into the ground. Thereby, it reduces the level of moisture much needed for the fruit fullness of soil and turns the land into barren. Furthermore, it takes hundreds of years for a single plastic bottle to decompose in our ecosystem. Therefore, to get rid of the heaps of plastic waste, people generally burn the domestic and industrial non degradable waste, and this process emits extremely harmful gases namely carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. These gases deteriorate the quality of air and accelerate the air pollution by increasing the percentage of minute particles. In addition, the chemicals in the plastic products often reach water bodies and affect the quality of water. This results in the devastation of marine wildlife and vegetation.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the issues caused by plastic products on our ecosystem / environment, the government should issue strict guidelines like banning the utilisation of single use plastic as well as its manufacturing. Owing to these measures, the presence of unwanted material will automatically decrease in our surroundings. Gradually, the quality of air, soil and water will improve. Similarly, people should apply the policy of reducing and reusing the material. If people use carry bags made of cloth instead of plastic, it will prove as a turning point in protecting / saving our ecosystem. Also people should adopt the habit of reusing and recycling the products available to them. This will control the consumption and manufacturing of articles of plastic. In other words, joint efforts of the administration and citizens are required to bring about a drastic change.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, plastic pollutes the air, water and soil and thus harms our environment in so many ways. Collective efforts of the government and the public are required to control the use and abuse of plastic."}

That means as much as number of good reviews then, as much as profit for the business as well. For instance, There are shop \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d in the same location, venue A recieved 5 star reviews from a thousan people while venue B just got only 20 peoples for 3 star reviews,thus clearly that when people see both store reviews, shop A is the best selection choice definitely. Consequently, nowadays, most stores attempt to collect the positive comments on social network as much as possible to lead their business growths, even add the promotion for the customer who provide a good review for them. \r\n\r\nIn spite of this, it cannot be denied that plentiful reviews are fake. As both users who support those businesses by write an exaggrerate review and even the people who focus to destroy those works by provide them a demerit commend. That because of some of them might recieved funds to built up the unreal merit comments ,which the same as those people who anti thoes brands personally as they may try to add a negative story on their reviews as well. To illustrate, the main financial fund that YouTubers earn from their sponsors, therefore, they cannot review anything drawback about the products that they recieved from their sponsors. Accordingly, we cannot touch anything until we try or face it by ourself.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, Although customer reviews on social media have plentiful beneficially impacts for the new customers and sales, there are enormous fake reviews that we cannot touch as well."}

Firstly, staying at home to work eliminates the need to travel to the site. As a result of that, the cost of comminution is alleviated as well as it saves a lot of time. Furthermore, this leads to the relief of traffic congestion in the downtown. In addition to that, people will have more flexibility in their time management. the reason for this is that They don`t have to clock in and out at certain times. This leads to them having an excellent work-life balance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, going to the office has its own benefits. in the first place, working in groups elevates communication and interaction between co-workers. This is because a lot of new ideas are presented and exchanged between them. Consequently, this leads to a healthier performance. Additionally,  by being on-site, clerks tend to be more productive as they are more concentrated on their jobs. This causes their businesses to do well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although working through the Internet provides jobholders with comfy working conditions, being inside the company makes workers more motivated and helps them provide quality products."}

After that, they are divided into 2 groups: good and bad ones so that tomato ketchup can get as high quality as possible. Good tomatoes are continuously delivered to factories, where they have detached some unnecessary parts including removing stalks, skin, and seeds from the inner parts. Having been stored in a container, tomatoes are crushed to become liquid. At this point, sugar, salt and vinegar are added, aiming to flavour. The next step is that the liquid is boiled and then left for 2 hours in order to get the right temperature.\r\n\r\nAfter the steps of fabricating tomatoes ketchup, it is poured into bottles, which are then labelled.

Although, they pay taxes in their lifespam but as they become older they need more medication services. For example, tablets, private nurse, wheelchair and so on. In addition, they need more attention and transportation options have to be provided for all aged members. Because, they can not easily walk in steeps or use taxi and bus.

First and foremost, they belong to entirely professional companies, Such as Netflix or Sony. Accordingly, the best directors who are able to absorb the best screen plays or actress in across the world have been accompanying with them. Therefore, after watching those kinds of movie folk expectancies are going to be increase towards local movies. To illustrate it, after watching Avatar which belongs to the one of the most famous company Fax, movies seekers unconsciously compare the features with itself movies. On the other hand, curiosity might be another reason regardless of how a film is perfectly created. Thus, people find details of other cultures full of experiences. like what they ponder, how interact, or even associated foods and clothes. \r\n\r\nIn my sight, there is a strong connection between how much countries consider budget and how their movies are becoming well-known. However, the measure of that might not be as much as international movies in particular those are related Hollywood.

On one hand, there are numerous advantages that come with this flexibility, but on the other hand, there are also a great amount of disadvantages. In this essay,  I am going to focus and examine this question from both points of view.\r\n\r\n       Firstly, on one side of the argument, there are individuals who think that an important benefit of working from home is time-saving. As a result, most individuals lose a serious amount of time in traffic, as well as in public transportation. A particularly good example here is a recent study, which shows that an average person usually spends around one to two hours, going and coming from their workplace.\r\n\r\n      Secondly, one of the main problems that arrives with working outside the office, is the lack of interaction with other people. As a consequence of this, numerous individuals tend to become unsociable and uncomfortable around people. One good illustration of this is the multitude of our society members, which declared that after long periods of time working from home, they became more shy and introverted.\r\n\r\n       On the whole, the development of information technology has both positive as well as negative effects on our work environment. As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that the advantages that come with this flexibility outweigh its disadvantages."}

This trend has merits and demerits as well.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the benefits of this change are varied. Firstly, local people can achieve enormous provisions by gardening. The most important thing is that during harvesting citizens are able to get reliable products. As a consequence, they can consume healthy fruits and vegetables, which are rich in vitamins and minerals as well. ,Also it can fill the people's deficit for healthy fruit. Furthermore,  gardening is a good motivation, which leads to a healthy lifestyle. In truth, gardens need regular care by individuals. This, in turn, makes people do regular physical work. Additionally, they might avoid obesity and remedy other health issues. In a sense, there will be a more healthy and hardworking population. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there are also some serious drawbacks to this phenomenon. It is true that there are not enough green areas for other local residents in some regions. Hence, a plethora of people might stay without gardens. According to scientists' words, walking through parks can relieve people's stress. However, due to the ,gardens there will be a lack of spaces for relaxation. Lastly, giving open fields for gardening may affect other spheres of the economy.  To put it simply, an agricultural country without industry is not able to develop in all respects. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that changing some public places into gardens and guiding them for local dwellers is not a positive development."}

In the middle, the 25-metre pool, reception desk as well as the changing room and seating will remain unchanged, except for the gym which is intended to be extended to the eastern side. \r\n\r\nAnother modernization planned to be carried out is that the number of changing rooms will increase to meet students' needs. One of which will be in the southwest and the other will be located in the southeast.

To handle the serious societal problem, businesses have been proposed to move to country areas.

Moreover, a threat to those kids' psychological health careful consideration. \r\n\r\nOne of the compelling merits of location change of businesses, addressing traffic congestion cases happening, such as the lack of parking areas, and car accidents. Consequently, most of the residents can save much time, spending in handling the diverse array of annoying traffic issues. In addition, crowded housing almost will be solved, because some families have family members who are employed in some big businesses that will be moved into rural regions, and these households definitely follow their companies and live in regions, far away from suburban regions. As a result, the rest of the individuals will get more space to live. Lastly, the plan may stimulate the economic development of country regions, relying on the number of inhabitants has surged with an influx of business, especially, bringing more commercial behavior, such as merchandise purchases; thus, benefitting both local individuals' life standards. \r\n\r\nHowever, the disadvantage of the idea is equally pronounced. it may bring a negative influence on younger mental health. Advanced educational sources that are located in the metropolis, have become a major reason why most parents choose to live far away from their children when they need to work in suburban areas. Moreover, although it is beneficial for the development of kids' independence, obviously, damages their psychological health due to the lack of emotional support. Hence, business relocation may allow some younger parents stuck in a dilemma.\r\n\r\nIn essence, the proposition of business relocation from the city to the suburb definitely offers an effective solution for housing and traffic issues in the metropolitan, while encouraging the development of the economy in country areas. Nevertheless, exacerbating mental health for children living without parents, cannot be dentable. To strike a balance, local governments and authorities must allocate more funding to foster the richness of the educational system in rural regions, while encouraging businesses to move."}

This discrepancy in work ethics raises questions about the reasons behind these differences and whether working harder is always advantageous. Understanding the underlying factors and implications of varying work ethics is crucial to foster a more productive and balanced workforce.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors contribute to the differences in work ethics among individuals. Intrinsic motivation plays a vital role, with passionate individuals having clear goals and being more inclined to work harder. Cultural background and upbringing also influence work ethics, as those raised in environments that value hard work are more likely to exhibit a strong work ethic. Moreover, external incentives, recognition, and rewards in the workplace or educational settings can influence an individual's willingness to put in extra effort.\r\n\r\nWorking harder often leads to numerous benefits. It enhances productivity and efficiency, resulting in higher output and improved performance. Diligent individuals are more likely to acquire advanced skills, positioning themselves for better career opportunities. Moreover, their commitment and dedication can inspire others, fostering a positive and competitive environment. In the context of education, hardworking students tend to achieve higher grades, gain a deeper understanding of subjects, and develop valuable study habits for the future.\r\n\r\nWhile working harder can bring several advantages, it is not always a universally beneficial approach.

Their company never talks about the disadvantage of soft drinks on children's physical and mental health. \r\n\r\nThus, schools and parents must teach children the skills to evaluate and analyze advertisements. \r\n\r\nSecondly, children cannot differentiate between actual TV programs and commercials. \r\n\r\nTo explain more, children see advertising as their media food. That is, as it uses the content of an animation, cartoon, or puppet program, she also consumes advertising. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, using children's film heroes and favorite cartoon characters in advertisements should be illegal. Advertising gives children the illusion that everyone has free access to all material things. For example, companies should not advertise fast food to children while they are growing up because it can be disadvantageous for children. Thus, some countries have already banned advertising targeted at young children. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, not only is advertising bad for children and parents, but also it is significantly impacting their mental and physical health. It would be a great idea if countries banned advertising, not only parents are helped but children are helped too."}

In my view, I believe that  the main priority of every country and governments is that they ought to emphasis on their own citizens because they are certain issues that need to be handled.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are some reasons why governments could not always help poor people outside of their country. This is because they already have some obstacles within the country that should be tackled rather than help others. For example, air pollution and traffic congestion are the main increasingly worrying problems facing the whole world. Instead of supporting people in need in other parts of the world government should concentrate on solving existing problems that people are experiencing. Therefore, in my point of view focus should be placed to deal with problems within the country. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is believed by some countries from disadvantaged background should be given humanitarian aid by some affluent countries. Some countries, for example, African nationals are facing some difficulties such as famine and suffering from certain diseases as well. To be addressed this problem developed states ought to assist these developing countries in need with drugs foods and clothes as well as sending qualified doctors to treat patients who became a victim some serious illness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is hard to help all people around the world in need so governments should meet their citizens needs to make their lives better than aid others."}

While some people argue that it is necessary for buying the advanced products which arrive in the market as well as  special discounts, others believe that there is no time to pay attention to these commercial ads as they are really common. This essay will discuss both views and argue in favour of the former.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, if advertising of products is not held, the masses will not be able to acquire   knowledge of the products which are introduced in the supermarkets. Therefore, bulletins help to purchase the latest items coming across the world. Moreover, it also provides  intensive knowledge of how appliances work and flourishes with deals on the items which ultimately encourage humankind to buy things. For instance, people are more indulged in shopping during  Boxing Day in Canada as most of the outlets are posting  deals on the special brand at the end of the year.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, humans are so hectic with their schedules therefore, they do not have enough duration to pay attention to these offers going on television or social media platforms. In the current era, prices of every item are so high that people just want to purchase those things which are required and they can run for perennial. Most of them just skip these ads as they think that it is waste of time in watching these advertisements. For example, a YouTube director predicted that 99% of individuals prefer to skip the advertisement at the start of a new video because they think it is useless to watch them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although adverts are so common to be avoided to preserve time,  they play a significant role in saving chunks of money by forcing people to buy products when there are deals going on as well as they also provide detailed information on items."}

In my opinion, there are many valuable things that almost all people can study based on these arts.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, nowadays, humans have many kinds of entertainment activities which help the spiritual enhancement of life. These activities are not indispensable for balancing life and work. It is because of its benefits that it is easy to find short-term art classes widely held in many centres as a method of relaxation, emotional expression and creativity. This is extremely necessary in daily life while science and technology seem to ignore them.\r\n\r\nBesides, art also creates the human value through their work that no technology can be transmitted. Take a writer for an example, they have strong power to spread meaningful stories and positive energy to communities that can contribute, maintain and develop the good culture and tradition of each nation. Moreover, In medicine, doctors used music as a tool to ease the pain of the treatment regimens, especially for patients who meet mental problems. This not only brings many benefits but also reduces recovery time.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, science and technology bring much knowledge about modern things but art helps people deeply understand and know what they want to be.Therefore, both of them should be maintained and developed equally to ensure no loss of traditional and cultural value of the nation."}

In this essay, I will express my agreement with the view that the ultimate aim of science should indeed be to enhance human\u2019s need, supported by relevant examples from various scientific advances.\r\n\r\nOne of the most compelling examples of science is in the field of medicine. To be more specific, the development of vaccines and antibiotics has changed the face of healthcare and saved millions of lives. For example, the cure for smallpox is evident in science's ability to alleviate human suffering and prevent the death of countless individuals. \r\n\r\nIn addition, science also helps to improve lives and also extends to conserving the environment. Research on climate change and sustainable energy solutions is vital to preserving the planet. The ideals of reducing carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources are essential to mitigating the impacts of climate change on communities around the world.\r\n\r\nUltimately, science has played a crucial role in agriculture development, enabling increased food production and solving hunger.  Through the development of crop varieties and advanced farming practices, science has improved the lives of farmers and consumers. For example, the Green Revolution significantly increased crop yields, alleviating food shortages in some areas of the world.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the core purpose of science must certainly revolve around improving people's lives. Also, science can continue to be a powerful field for good, promoting a brighter future for all of humanity."}

However, scientific research have oriented a laboratory grown vegetables, which would indirectly help to regenerate human need in agriculture shortage.

This means that many of these people will die or come to serious harm if they are not accepted by western states and it is therefore moral imperative that they allow them in. That is  to say that if they do not shelter and feed them they would be responsible for many deaths and terrible suffering. For example, migrants from Syria are escaping a brutal war and this is the reason why Germany and other European countries have decided to grant hundreds of thousands of them asylum.  \r\n\r\n      Thousands of extra people coming into a country will also help boost the economy. This is because there will be more workers available and they will, in turn, pay tax and also buy goods and services in that country. They may need extra financial support in the beginning, but this will be paid back many times over if they stay and work. For example, millions of Vietnamese people were forced to leave their homeland in the 1970s and many of them have established thriving businesses in the USA which pay billions of dollars in tax every year.  \r\n\r\n      In conclusion, refugees should be accepted with open arms by countries in the western hemisphere because it is the right thing to do on moral grounds and it will also benefit the host countries monetarily in the future."}

In this essay, I will delineate its importance as well as its benefits and drawbacks.\r\n\r\nLife without a goal or an ambition to achieve something is like, running without direction. You are going nowhere. There is a difference between human beings and animals, and that is the goal to do something in life.

However, there are certain measures that can be taken to resolve this issue and make learning more fun and enjoyable for students. \r\n\r\nPrimarily, the lack of attention is due to the traditional teaching techniques followed by institutions. Passive teaching is sure to bore students rather than develop their talents since each student's grasping ability differs. The teachers are instructing students to memorise the answers instead of engaging in brainstorming and creative learning activities. The students rely on their memory and write the answer in the examination, which becomes the reason for frustration among the students. The use of portable devices such as mobile phones during lectures is another source of distraction. Instead of focusing on academics, students spend the majority of their time playing video games and surfing the internet. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if instructors in schools use active learning techniques, in which each student is given the opportunity to exhibit what they have learned, students' learning will increase. Teachers should also use a variety of instructional strategies to pique students' interest and engagement, such as presenting videos, engaging through presentations, and personally contacting students. Finally, because distractions like video games and cell phones are the most prevalent cause of a child's lack of interest in studying, they should be banned in schools, and parents should impose a daily usage restriction on them. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, modern teaching techniques should be implemented in order to develop students' enthusiasm for learning and gadgets should be prohibited and limited because they tend to act as a barrier and reduce students' effectiveness"}

Thus, they can be less and less accessible to move in the rush hour. For example, an abundance of children have to eat junk food while they are stuck on the road, moreover, they spend their single hurry lives. So, to tackle this problem the government should pay  considerable attention to keeping their citizens free of housing trouble and they should prevent  mass transportation or business from being centred at a mere location. \r\n\r\nConsequently, to overcome this situation,  economic policy should play an important role to encourage  businesses to move to the rural area.

Many people believe that attitude can show how far the students have learned. Moreover, the ability to answer teacher questions correctly means they learn seriously and regularly. These habits will shape them to become disciplined and responsible. It will help them to get better scores at school. For illustration, pupils that review their material at home will get a better understanding of that subject. Consequently, pupils can be more competitive to get the best score.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are many ways to achieve academic success. However, many people believe that teachers become the most important part to make students good at school. Meanwhile, others argue that attitudes and abilities to answer teachers' questions are essential parts of gaining success in academics. I am firmly convinced that good attitudes and abilities play important roles in academic success."}

For example, the shifting of payment methods that will be used when people do shop. There will be a new payment method using cards or payment applications on a smartphone. This payment method can be called a cashless payment method. It will help people in more efficiently when bringing a thing during shopping.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some people who may not agree with this new payment method. Several people who tend to not be happy with this event are coming from sellers.

This extra charge most likely applied to the store ,not the customer. Stores will be facing a decrease in their revenue from this regulation.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, a shifting of payment methods from cash to cashless will happen in the future due to the development of technology.

What do\r\n\r\nyou feel are the main causes of this? What are the effects?", "content": "In this day, the worldwide percentage of obese people is rapidly increasing. Although often debated, a major cause is due to the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food choices. In this essay, a look at these causes and their effects will be made.\r\n\r\n   Firstly, the two most major reasons for obesity are due to the unhealthy lifestyle and diets with a lack of nutrients trends in the 21st century. For instance, a study conducted by the American obesity society found that the fast meal industry market has increased doubled since the 2000s. It can easily be seen when people have busy daily lives, they towards to choose easy lunches and dinners with fast foods and microwavable diets, which contain much fat and sugar content. Moreover, people don\u2019t spend their time taking part in exercise in their daily lives. Thus, this lack of physical activities combined with processed food lead to  overweighting. \r\n\r\n   The effects of obesity are countless but a major one is that obesity leads to massive health problems. To illustrate, as evidenced in the United Kingdom, many scientists have pointed out that over 70 percent of fat people likely to face up with diseases such as heart failure, and diabetes, which are two of the leading causes of death. As a result, millions of dollars have been spent each year due to their diabetes and heart failure medications. Thus, it is clear that these effects need to be mostly decreased to reform the quality of life for future generations. \r\n\r\n   To conclude,  awareness and healthy food options, as well as, more social physical exercise are  significant ways to prevent  obesity. It is predicted that both schools and parents will encourage their children to have nourishing diets and follow  healthy lifestyle trends."}

Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "In today's world, obesity is becoming a big problem in many parts of the world. Recently, the number of obsessed people is increasing so fast that some suggest that, the main culprits like fast food and unhealthy food, needed to be taxed to discourage people from consuming too much. This essay will try to argue that increasing the price of junk food will not help people fight this obesity crisis.\r\n\r\nIn human history, obesity was never run rampant like this before. The obesity pandemic is a very modern problem, in the past, it is very hard to find poor people who were overweight in contrast to the present where most of the obsessed people come from low-income households. The main cause of this is that most of the time the only food these low-income people can afford is either low-quality and low-price fast food or heavily processed food that has low nutrition but high sugar and fat to compensate for the low-quality ingredient used to keep the price low. By levying the tax on junk food industries it will, in reality, make the problem much worse than it already is. If junk food increases in price then it will force people who can bearly afford to consume this already low-quality product to find the even lower-quality alternative.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, rather than put a tax on low-quality food it is better to spend money subsidizing or cutting taxes on healthy food options. If the root cause of obesity comes from overconsumption of low-quality consumption goods then the solution is to change the consumer choice. Since food is an essential part of life it is impossible to tell people to eat less expressly to those low-income who bearly scrape by even with low-cost fast food. Giving some incentives, like lowering taxes on healthier option products or subsidizing high-quality unprocessed ingredients, to fast food chains and food manufacturers to produce healthier products for the same price as the unhealthy product can help solve the overweight problem in the lower class who the most susceptible to the obesity pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion . For many people being obsessed didn't come from their personal choice but the lack of choices that cause them to resort to fattening food for sustenance. By giving those people a healthier affordable option, it will help them much more in the long term than to just increasing the prices of junk food which is their only option for food. And that is why I strongly disagree with increasing fast food prices as a solution to the obesity problem."}

In the meantime, there is some opinion that stands for the government needs to be focused on educating adults who need education instead of the youth. From my perspective, I completely agree with the statement that we government need to invest more in elder education. In this particular essay, I will elaborate the consideration of my views.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it needs to realize that number of education for adults could be low due to the limited access for them to pursue an education particularly in the previous decade with a minimum facility from the country, for instance in the rural area. Therefore, it leads them to the low opportunity for having a job that impacts their economy and they do not have enough money for their family. As an effect  As a result of this situation, they even can not they cannot afford to send their children to go to school. It will make the cycle of poverty in the family will revolves and perpetuate/continue/persist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if there is a public policy on enlarging the opportunity for education access for the elderly. For example, an education to develop soft skills such as Reading, Basic Mathematics, and Basic Digital or Information Technology Education it will help them to broaden their competencies and can give them new skills which can be used for them to apply for a job since the opportunity to them will rise up because of the competencies that they have. Their life will be better than before, and they can fulfill their family\u2019s primary needs because of the cash that they get from their jobs. This policy also can help to decrease the poverty number in the country.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is important for the government in investing the elder\u2019s education access to help them have a good life for their family and so on. In addition, an opportunity for adults in getting knowledge can impact the country\u2019s development in the case of poverty as well."}

In this essay, therefore, the reasons and the opinions will be discussed and the following example will be provided in order to support my point of view.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that novelists and TV producers are attracting the reader and  viewers by exaggerating suspense scenes. From this sentence I will concentrate more on the TV shows that had a massive impact on people's imaginations because the producer utilises technological methods to attract them and make them feel curious, so they want to know more about what is happening next. Moreover, some stories are related to real life. For example, a couple lovers had been killed by a mysterious guy or stories about unbelievable massive accidents all around the world by well know scientists. Having said that, the entertainment from curious crime stories had  attracted more people to watch or read them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believed that entertainment cush as films about crime dramas can have a major effect in different ways. For instance, mature will enjoy and learn from the movie that situations or circumstances might be happening so they will realise and be more different themself when it happens. However, children or less mature people might think that violence from TV is normal and they may manipulate it because they think humans from TV shows can do, so they can do the same as well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, crime stories are popular and increasingly more viewers  watch  films. therefore, parents must supervise their children about pros and cons of  crime stories."}

To develop it further, travel agents have utilized all their means to create new experiences. But in the process, there have been some hot debates about whether or not commercializing cultural traditions is a sensible decision. In my opinion, both views have their legitimate reasons.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the continuous expansion of tourism has several consequences. The first negative effect is that heritage sites and monuments are jam-packed with tourists, causing damage to them. For instance, the influx of tourists in the ancient town of Hoi An carved their names on the walls, which vandalized the historical landmark. Moreover, the uncontrolled development of tourism can deteriorate the environment and threaten wildlife. A simple example is Nha Trang beach with garbage floating all over its coast, causing loss of scenery, water pollution, and harm to marine life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that putting a price on cultural tours is the only method to keep them from fading away. First, revenue from sightseeing, art performances, and other tourist activities is used largely for restoration efforts. Without enough financial support, various attraction sites may fall into disrepair. Another reason is that tourism helps promote cultural exchange. Tourists can visit many historical significance places and talk to local people to gain an in-depth understanding about the area's culture. This encourages the revival of traditions and elevates cultural values.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is beyond doubt that developing tourism brings both positive and negative impacts. Governments and authorities should not lose sight of this fact before deciding on expanding the tourism industry."}

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.", "content": "In the modern era, well know associations run all kinds of employment and reach  the peak of success as compared to small or unestablished trade. I think advantages are more than disadvantages. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, employment opportunities are increased because of  the establishment of big companies. They need more well-educated people to run different businesses. As well as appoint less experience communities in different positions ,for example, janitorial staff, and cafeteria staff. The second benefit is eligible people get an opportunity to prove themselves through their work and share their skills with other people, who have less experience. For example; if the person who works as an accountant has an issue solving problem related to Social issues, he or she can get help from the other person who has experience in the Social field. The third benefit is to contribute to the development of the country because we all know that business reflects the economy of the country. Big companies have approached to settle down their relations with other countries. For example, business partnerships with other companies.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, with the development of multi-national companies people get attracted and start to ignore private businesses for example; people start  buying vegetables and all household items from the grocery store rather than street vendors so the street vendors feel helpless and shut down their business. Secondly, life will be harder for illustrate people because they do not have the basic education and resources which they require to run big companies as compared to educated people. for instance; an educated person can run any kind of business but a person who has no knowledge of business survives in poverty.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Overall big companies provide better opportunities for employment as well as better future options."}

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "It is considered that increasing the supply of some famous consumable item which was actually not in demand can be achieved with the influence of advertisement. I completely agree with this concept because an interesting presentation creates curiosity and most people fall for it despite the real cost-benefit-need analysis. In this essay, we will see how it works with some examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  advertisements create an interactive interface in a person's mind and when they are interesting and relevant by any means induce desire. In my hometown, people are fond of making a special sweet called Khasta as it is a household name and included in everyday meals. Citizens use traditional equipment made of wood to shape it as shaping with hands is tedious and time-consuming. A famous Kitchen utensil manufacturer developed the same device out of steel and brought it into the market but was unsuccessful. Then they began advertising after 3 years of product lunch and soon their sales tripled the following year. But soon the habitats realized that the sweet was missing in taste, texture and durability. \r\n\r\nLater, after numerous consumer complaints, the local government began to investigate. when the inspection was completed it was found that there was no problem with the manufacturer's equipment but it was the wood which rich the taste. The report says  it was the specific wood which has a unique compound called \"bibi\" in the local language which adds flavour to the sweet and was responsible for the preservation for a longer duration whereas the steel lacks that. Moreover, the tree was locally inhabited so the multinational manufacturer had no knowledge about it. They found that the product is very popular in other states however so, it would be an easy go, it did but did not prolong.\r\n\r\nOverall, the power of advertisement does increase sales in the market where there is no demand but how long the demand lasts is completely dependent on the consumer. Hence, I would suggest making proper research on the actual practice of the habitats before launching the device into the market."}

The governments have taken some measures at a global level. But they got only few solutions. Why is it so? How can this be solved?", "content": "Pollution and climate change are going up every day. Moreover, governments are offering solutions that are not effective on a worldwide scale. In this essay, I will explain the reasons behind this and provide some potential solutions.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the world now to 100 years ago, we can identify the problem. In the past, people lived in rural areas and consumed what they grew. However, after the industrial revolution, more communities migrated to cities and their habits shifted from being producers to consumers. Companies now strive to sell their products in order to increase their wealth, and governments do not have the authority to limit them, so even in developed countries this problem remained as it was. Additionally, the media industry and the internet assist companies in reaching customers worldwide. Resulting in increased use of fossil fuel products delivery. For instance, wooden types of furniture can produce in any country, but for the sake of advertisements, imported type is used.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the encouragement of excessive consumption. In the past one car was sufficient for a family, but now it has become common for each person to own their own car. With the increasing human population on Earth, the need for food is undeniable. As a result, organizations are employing conservation and other production techniques to produce and store food for longer periods of time or cutting trees of jungles to build construction for industrial reasons. However, this leads to the use of more industrial machines, facilities and pesticides in agriculture. While there are benefits to these practices, associations often use excessive amounts of water and pollute it before returning to nature. For example, in my country, one of the most well-known companies is a major contributor to water pollution as they release dirty water into rivers, and the government cannot do anything about it.\r\n\r\nIn summary, these changes are inevitable, but humans are accelerating them. The only way to slow down these changes is by teaching people to love the Earth like other creatures in the world."}

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "In today\u2019s interconnected world environmental pollution especially, four-wheelers are causes great damage to our planet in multiple ways, and to reduce this, Government should create a policy or a strategy of bringing electric transportation which is proven to efficient. I agree with the above-mentioned statement. Electric cars are more eco-friendly, and people can save money on petrol.\r\n\r\nFirstly, electric cars are environmentally friendly. Moreover, they don\u2019t produce any kind of pollution which would affect our planet besides, they don\u2019t need any kind of fuel to run. Therefore, they contribute to lower air pollution. Additionally, this kind of transport operates more quietly than traditional cars, reducing noise pollution. Hence, helps combat climate change and improve air quality. For example, instead of using traditional cars for those who deliver products to nearby areas such as Pizza, groceries, and other petty companies, promoting electric cars for deliveries can save enormous savings to them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these types of vehicles bring cost savings. As we discussed, in the first paragraph, they have lower operating cost compared to petrol cars, they are more predictable and non-fluctuating like petrol prices. Furthermore, the maintenance cost is very less, and their wear and tear are less frequent compared to other cars. Besides, we can have our own solar charger installed at home, and no need to go outside for charging the car. For example, Governments around the world offer rebates and incentives or grants to promote the adoption of these vehicles. Therefore, taking these advantages can bring significant cost savings.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, yes, I strongly agree that banning petrol and diesel cars would benefit and as mentioned above EVs are the most eco-friendly, improve air quality and reduce noise pollution. Additionally, they bring long-term cost savings too."}

What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?", "content": "It is needless to enlighten, today's world has modernized a lot compared to the old era. New technologies and developments have drastically changed the living style that can be observed evitably in our forefathers and current community. The latest innovations like smartphones, tablets, and other electronic gadgets are a nightmare for elderly people, they encounter troubles while dealing with modern machines. This essay will outline some causes being faced by old folks while using advanced machinery and solutions to curb this menace.\r\n\r\nThere are myriad reasons related to the problems of past generations in handling technological devices. First and foremost is unawareness of recent advancements. People from previous decades had limited resources and knowledge. There were not enough facilities available for them to learn and research about changes in the world, and the media was also restricted to certain areas only. Besides, technology itself not being mature compared to what it is in the day. For example, only a few people have smartphones equipped with very limited features. As a result, the old folks could not have opportunities to come in contact with a variety of technological development causing troubles for them in today's innovative nature. Another reason for the stated problem is the old generation's lack of information, literacy plays a vital role in human development. Because of poor education resources and limited investigation departments at the global level in the early 90s, the Elderly society spent most of its time hard working. For instance, conquering the moon was beyond the imagination. However, analysis blocks like NASA, Space X,  and many others around the world had achieved this milestone.\r\n\r\nThus, limited resources along with research centres, poor education systems, and unawareness of advancement were the main problematic areas for our forefathers in handling new technologies.\r\n\r\nThere are colossal ways and means that can be taken for its remedy. Firstly, the young generation has a pivotal role to deal with this problem. They should spend some of their time with their grandparents regularly to make them aware of the latest technologies like smartphones, and tablets and guide them about the benefits it has brought into our lives. In addition to that higher authorities should establish awareness centres, especially for old people where they can learn about modern innovation and also the usage of electronic gadgets.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, indeed, the old generation usually is not updated about the latest innovations and developments.

In my opinion, firmly agree with the notion because excessive use is harmful to humans and also animals. I will discuss the effects of fossil fuels in the ensuing paragraphs. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are numerous negative effects of the usage of fossil fuels. The combustion of gas produces a toxic substance of carbon dioxide which directly affects living creatures and causing of climate change. The weather these days is unpredictable because of climate change. Moreover, ozone depletion creates a cause of climate change. In other words, UV rays are direct reflect on the Earth which leads to skin cancer in the human body.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the international community promote  all  nations to reduce the usage of fossil fuels because the prominent reason that  is non-renewable energy or fuels in the near future,  will be extinct. Hence, these authorities suggest that find alternative options instead of fossil fuels. For example, the prime mister of India promotes electrical vehicles which save non-renewable energy. The survey by the Environment Department predicted that in Saudi Arabia, the production of gasoline and oil would decline in 2025 and the country no longer be able to export.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main cause of air pollution which creates by non-renewable sources. Consequently, all countries must work together to prevent the further depletion of fossil fuels and find alternative ways."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "In this modern era, there is a conflict regarding household duties as men and women both have to divide the chores equally among them. It is quite significant to notice that  women are the backbone of their families so there should be some equality and justice for them also. I totally agree with this statement that the job at home should be proportionally divided among both which will be discussed further in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, in earlier times only the males were the breadwinner for the family, however, nowadays, both  genders are working equally to earn for the family. Therefore, both should task together on the household schedule instead of throwing a woman in the kitchen after those long hours of working outside. For instance, they can divide the work according to their interest or also for odd-even days which will give a kind of relief to a woman too. Not only that, females are the ones who take care of their children. Nevertheless, makes are equal parents of the child so they should also take care of them by investing time in their study or play. \r\n\r\nMoving further, women are physically not that much stronger than men, then what is the logic behind forcing them to task alone at home? Unfortunately, ladies are considered as labour force so they are supposed to work the whole day no matter what is their strength as compared to another gender. Even though they are the ones who suffer from the natural cycle each month but who cares. Instead of making them suffer from all these situations, men as well as society have to understand their condition and let them work proportionally at home as compared to men.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, males and ladies should be considered equal in every hemisphere and if it is about working at the house then they should divide the chores equally. Females are also working outside with men to run the family and they are contributing equally as well. So instead of being physically and emotionally ,weaker they are taking care of household chores which should be divided same among them."}

Some people believe that due to this, many parts of the world will encounter a global crisis. Others feel that population is needed for boosting the economy of any country and society. This essay will elucidate both views with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, various areas of the world face a crisis of basic amenities due to scarcity of resources and overcrowding. This is possibly due to underdevelopment and a nonproductive workforce. For example, a region's growth is directly proportional to the intelligent and smart youth. If they are not fruitful, they will not grow to the intended level.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many developed countries require genius people to take care of many firms they have come up with. Moreover, it is of paramount importance that companies do well in terms of production that can be sent to those needy to fetch a reasonable amount of money. For instance, a country producing abundant amounts of grains can be exported to those where it is intensely short of it. This could be due to unfavourable conditions in the country that prevent them from cultivating it. Hence, they rely on getting them imported. To do all these in a sophisticated manner, sensible manpower is required.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I would say overcrowding could be a question  when it comes to managing the population ; however, it is very essential to have accountable people to take care of the developed things within to ensure well earning.\r\n\r\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android"}

In my opinion, such a type of labour law will stop exploitation and will have a positive impact on the workers.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons behind the long working duties. Mainly, the invention of new technologies keeps employees busy even after their daily office time.For example, it is too easy to be in touch with your clients through notifications on the smartphone or e-mail. It is mandatory for some higher-level person to reply to it. Secondly, during industrial, expansion  employers take advantage of needy employees and push them to work for 12-14 hours as a slave, and if they deny they may suffer from job loss or maybe  financial issues.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the limited working time law offers a worker to have a mental, physical and social pace. Like, factory workers hardly get moments to spend with their families as they suppose to stay on the same premise after long duties. The limited engagement of work will help them to spend a good time with their family which leads to strong family life. To continue, in such countries where there are no rules of labour time forces too manpower in physical exploitation especially with child labour.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the need for laws related to controlling working hours occurs because of new inventions and unlimited greed. By introducing, law it becomes easy to develop both a mental and social environment in the country by considering its own perspective."}

However, these vehicles lead to some environmental problems such as air pollution, global warming, climate change and so on. Therefore, people need a comprehensive plan to address the results of using vehicles. Some cities have vehicle-free days to promote the use of public transport. In my opinion, despite some obvious drawbacks which should not be overlooked, I think the benefits of a vehicle-free day outweigh.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of using public transport should be taken into consideration. The major benefit of using public transport which should be initially referred to is that people can be more healthy and problems in the field of environment reduce sharply. Vehicle pollutants harm our health and contain greenhouse gases that cause climate change. If people are unaware of climate change possibility, they will face its results which are famine, drought, and flooding. For instance, a survey found that more than 45% of people living in cities which are not used public transport have more risk to be asthma and breathing difficulties because of toxic gases.\r\n\r\nAnother significant advantage of using public transport is that it helps to protect nonrenewable energy resources which as oil. Due to the ever-increasing number of people, nonrenewable energy resources reduce dramatically. However, people need these energy resources because they are energy-rich and relatively cheap to process. For this reason, thanks to vehicle-free days, people can be aware of the detrimental effects of oil consumption.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, vehicle-free days are beneficial to prevent mentioned above adverse effects of using private vehicles."}

First of all, It is evident to everybody that working conditions have become more complicated, and this situation has led to confined employees to their job in order to keep their job secure. Furthermore, life expenses have become a principal dilemma among folks. They should afford the cost of rent, installments, or even unforeseen expenses like disease treatment. Hence, these causes play a key role in employees' mental health.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that employers could act as a vital role in combating the devastating disorder. For instance, employers can offer some promotions based on employees' competency. Employers can consider a program for employees in which they can raise their salary if they have some proposals in order to enhance company income. On the other hand, employers can consider a break time for rest each hour or even provide some gaming counselors in order to have moments of tranquility and vitality with colleagues. Therefore, there are several opportunities that employers can offer to cease employees' mental issues.\r\n\r\nTo draw a conclusion, it should be reiterated that even though financial barriers are an inseparable dilemma in this hectic life, employers could act as a vital role in alleviating this detrimental disorder."}

While  the old generation has a lack of problems using it. Because  In past decades people were doing every work with hand made. They all have conversations with each other through  letters and posts. But, At present era totally changed so, There is a number of technical devices available for every work.

In this essay, I will outline arguments for and against the method of study and I will state my viewpoint on this issue.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the majority of people are convinced that it provides positive impacts for pupils to do group-based study at school. To express it more plainly, the shared study approach motivates students to take part in discussions and find  solutions by brainstorming with one another which really makes the study process fun and interesting. Not only are the students encouraged to be more active, but also they learn teamwork as well as other social skills. To give an instance, Although some courses were too boring and tedious for me during university, I found out that by collaborative learning with other students, I can make them too entertaining and get good grades as group study avoid us to be tired.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some individuals who opine that it is advantageous for students to study lonely. To put it another way, they believe that pupils must be able to analyze  scientific subjects alone to learn  problem-solution skills. For instance, some surveys and research showed that students who sued to study alone usually have better capabilities to come up with difficulties and are able to control hard situations. Moreover, they can be better tutors in future too. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, both methods are advantageous for students provided that they opt for one of the correct methods regarding their interests and the characteristics of the courses. I myself found both of them applicable during school and university. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, both group study and study alone have their own advantages such as motivating students and strengthening problem solution skills of pupils, respectively."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.", "content": "In recent years, globalization and multinational companies have grown rapidly, and some people argue that they have drawbacks for the environment. I entirely agree with this statement due to the increasing amount of gas emissions and decreasing green spaces that I will discuss in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirst, the growth of globalization makes it easier for people to travel anywhere and anytime; however, it can effect the environment due to the increasing amount of gas emissions. Most people prefer to commute by using their private vehicles or an airplane if they go aboard. As a consequence, using those transport modes can result in gas emissions, which can destroy our environment. For example, the top executive managers in big companies who have several offices in different countries will use airplanes and private cars when they have meeting agendas in different locations. These vehicles produce much more gas emissions when they travel frequently, which will affect our environment. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the expansion of multinational companies also has an effect on the environment, especially our green spaces, which are decreasing. When multinational companies will expand their businesses or factories in other places, it directly affects the green ecosystem environment, which is decreasing in forest and woodland areas. The natural balance is also disturbed. For instance, Nestle company has several branch offices and factories in various countries, and this takes up a lot of land in many countries. As a result, green spaces are decreasing as this company continues to expand its businesses and factories in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that globalization and the increasing number of multinational companies have a negative effect on the environment due to the fact that increasing gas emissions and green space issues."}

Others, However, think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "In the present time, individuals around the world take the view that routine is preferable to any changes. In contrast, others believe that change has a beneficial role in our lives. The objective of this essay is to discuss both of this and give my own perspective with relevant examples in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo embark with, many people avoid changes because they might like being stable without unnecessary changes. For instance, people who want to spend their lives  pursuing a single career path without any promotions. Moreover, one of the reasons why individuals tend to do this due to their fear and  not being willing to take a risk. Such risks as losing a job or hatred from colleagues. This is the most habitual for the Japanese population. Their cultural beliefs and traditions do not allow such behaviour where workers ask for a promotion. It is thought to be rude by the Japanese society. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others advocate that changes are important and always have positive effects on a person and his surroundings. In other words, without change individuals can not reach their pinnacle and aim. Also, it was proven by scientists that a person who tends to change has  more changes to stay mentally health. That is because when people expand their knowledge and learn about new activities which are unusual for them, the brain  activates neurons to cope with difficulties. Therefore, these actions are connected with human change by implication. As a result, change has a positive impact on individuals' development and mental health. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are two opinions, those who appreciate change and those who do not. Change has an important function in developing the brain and personality. However, some societies do not prefer change due to their culture and tradition.  From my own perspective, change matters, and being flexible is much more important nowadays than ever."}

Next, those dried ones are roasted by heat in the oven before being cooled rapidly in a cooler. After cooling, a grinder machine is used to crush beans into powder. \r\n\r\nMoreover, once ground, the powder is mixed with hot water and then the mixture is strained carefully. In the following stage, it is frozen in the freezer at a low temperature before being pulverized again. Subsequently, the combination is dried in a vacuum in order to let all the left liquid evaporate. Finally, the final products are packed into jars to get ready for sale in shops and supermarkets."}

Others say that it is important for\r\n\r\nchildren to team how to occupy themselves on their own.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.", "content": "Some family heads argue that young children should participate in social settings rather than engage in individual activities. This essay will discuss both views and why I think it is essential to mingle with others.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, parents choose to let their children carry out free time activities on their own to develop independence. When children work independently, they acquire skills that will be useful for their future such as being able to solve problems. Furthermore, not having to spend time with a lot of people allows them to avoid disagreements with friends. Children find it easier to play online games than to go out to the park. Therefore, parents desire their children to stay home and do what they love on their own.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, research indicates that collaboration between young children enhances social and confidence skills. First, as young youths do things with their mates, they develop good communication skills by initiating and contributing to conversations. Hence, in future when they are young adults, they are prepared to face the challenges that come with working with different people. For example, as they participate in group settings, they become capable communicators and learn from other people's perspectives. Secondly, spending time with peers' supports the development of confidence. This is achieved when youths share ideas and extend on them, as a result, they build on their self-esteem knowing that their thoughts are valued. Therefore,  it is important that children should get out of their comfort zone and meet people to strengthen life's essential skills such as social and confidence skills.\r\n\r\nIn summary, some people think children should spend time on their own, while others think they should socialise. I think the latter is essential because it helps with skills for social life and confidence."}

Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local people  to visit this historical  sites and museums?", "content": "It is true that most historical sites and museums attract a larger number of tourists; however, local people are less interested. In my opinion, there are numerous reasons for this trend. I will discuss the reason and also give a solution in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, people are bored visiting such places. In other words, local citizens know about their own cities therefore, it is not new for them. Hence, they think that such visits are a waste of time. However, tourists are very excited to explore new things in their destinations. Museums and  historical sites will help to understand the history and culture of the countries they visit. Another reason is that these types of places tickets are very expensive. If people visited once that they would not pay the higher entrance fees.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are several solutions to these situations. Firstly, the government should organise campaigns to attract the local public such as free education seminars, health care camps and other programs which will attract. Moreover, the authority of such places gives extra discounts or is free for locals. So that, low and middle-income families can visit. For example, schools or colleges give assignments to the student related to history and they interact with historical places. Lastly, the organisation give more and more job opportunity to the local public. Hence, they work in such places and pursue more knowledge about history.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the government can encourage more locals by running interesting programs such as exhibits at these locations and offering free or subsidized entry."}

Governments should embargo the sale of bottled water.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?.", "content": "It is argued by some individuals that government should restrict the sale of bottled water as water is a natural resource, and it should always be free of cost. However, I have a complete disagreement with this notion \r\n\r\nTo begin with, I believe free water facilities should only be free for people in public places, remote areas, or slum areas so that people can get clean, drinkable water free of charge. For example, in Indian villages and public places, railway stations, parks, and bazaars, clear tap water is viable for residents.  But, for residential or commercial use in cities or towns, For instance, in India, city authorities charge monthly water bills for water supplies. This method has discouraged civilians from wasting water. Nevertheless, some years ago, when tap water was free, per capita water utilization was considerably higher in urban areas.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the sale of bottled water is increasing significantly across the world and there are some specific reasons why  it should not be banned. Firstly, before packing water in bottles, it is properly purified so that it does impact the consumers. In other words, water purification standards are met by companies becoming water bottled, while in some countries, like India, Public tap water is too polluted and can cause health issues hence people avoid even free water and prepared packed water for drinking. Secondly, the suggestion of banning packed water would not be accepted by companies and the government would face agitation, if they go for implementing it. Because this decision will adversely impact the earnings of the bottled water business. Hence it is practically impossible to stop the sales of bottled water.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I believe that government should not put restrictions on the sale of bottled water and even it is difficult to impossible to make it free for every individual."}

Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "In the modern era, the majority of students are occupied with their academic lives and find little time for external sports activities, which are vital to their overall development.Some individuals believe that it is imperative that children participate in club athletics, while others disagree.In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and offer my opinion.\r\n\r\nInitially, athletics is essential to the physical and mental development of children. To live a happy and successful life in a world where the majority of adolescents remain indoors after school or spend the majority of their time on mobile devices or viewing television, thereby negatively affecting their health, is to engage in some form of athletic activity. Group sports teach them how to collaborate in a club setting.In addition, they have the opportunity to develop leadership abilities by serving as team leaders.Lastly, how to motivate team members in low morale situations and maintain team coordination. In a recent survey conducted by the sports council of India, it was found that teenagers who perform sports concurrently with their education have greater stamina, focus, and concentration than their peers.\r\n\r\nOpponents of group sports, on the other hand, argue that there is no need for group sports because it is a waste of time that could be spent on the academic front.Then, sometimes the leader always receives recognition for the team's overall performance, and talented youths are never given the opportunity to advance.In addition, they lose their study focus and spend the majority of their time performing sports.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after weighing the pros and cons, I am of the opinion that club sports are crucial to the success of children's careers and that they should participate in some form of physical activity."}

Some people say that these pictures are more effective than words.", "content": "In the modern world, photographs play a great role compared to the past. It is always a topic of discussion whether images are effective in comparison with written information or not. I will discuss this and share my opinion in the following paragraphs about these two factors.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, pictures portray a detailed explanation. For instance, a recent study of a few Indian neurologists organized a free analysis of the young generation. Under that, a few youngsters were shown certain historical images and others were given scriptures for the same pictures after a couple of hours, a few questions were asked of both groups to test them, and they found unimaginable data. Those who were shown images, were able to recall most of the data and were clear with what they saw under images, compared to 2nd group who were only able to remember a few things.    \r\n\r\nSecondly, compared to written or visual, a shot can bring more attention and better understanding.  \r\n\r\nAnother study, which is recently published by WHO scientist Roger Federer showed that humans are more capable of remembering pictures or videos compared to written information. After hearing this data, the Indian government has decided to change the way of educating and most prominently the small kids by adding more pictures & videos along with less written information in their syllabus because it is really easy to make children understand the facts and figures.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, images and drawings are more productive than written data, furthermore, this is really important to have great memories and keep humans grateful."}

From my perspective, I totally concur with this tendency, as it provides multiple benefits, especially in violence and crime rates, besides some other methods to ensure people's life and health. All of them will be clarified thoroughly through this essay.\r\n\r\nInitially, it is undeniable that guns, when being used by crime elements, ranging from thieves, robbers, gangsters, murder and so on,  become a bad thing, which put a higher risk in citizens whenever they leave their houses. Moreover, owning weapons as a defence method sometimes motivate peoples to choose violent ways when facing any issues. For instance, accommodating guns while having troubles when people's brains become impressively angry and unconscious can lead to regretful consequences, as many investigators have pointed out that people are inclined to solve problems due to their emotions more than their minds.\r\n\r\nBesides several reasons for prohibiting  bringing guns everywhere in towns, there are many substituted methods to replace this. Firstly, there should be more investment in security guards and safety management. Gaining people's trust is often seen as a more effective and feasible way to protect human life. Secondly, raising people's awareness through some propaganda classes and educating people in the right way might help to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it will be dangerous for people and others to carry guns whenever hanging out. This tendency should be deleted utterly in everyone's opinion"}

Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages", "content": "These days, as a result of the advent of technology in food making industry, a huge range of fast food become easily available and accessible to anyone. This, may include under-age people. Although there might be some benefits of the massive availability of fast meals, I believe that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\nTo embark on, it is true that many working parents nowadays are dependent on processed food for preparing daily meals for their families. The reason for this is that processed foods are easy to be prepared and also taste good. As a result, these parents will have more time to do other important jobs or errands. However, studies show that consuming an excessive amount of junk food has an appalling effect on our bodies. First, fast foods or processed foods have been processed through several steps before it served to the consumers. This means that essential nutrients are already cooked away and gone. This will be particularly dangerous for children as they may not receive the nutrients necessary for their growth. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, fast food contains a high levels of fats, calories and sugar that negatively affect our body in the long term. A study reveals that  unhealthy eating habit is one of the significant risk factors for chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These diseases are  the highest causes of death in The US and worldwide.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although fast food may be efficient, easy to prepare and taste good, we have to limit the consumption of this kind of food as it can have serious negative effects on our bodies."}

I think that finding a favourite job is the key to success, which directly causes this situation mentioned before. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we have to recognize that customized subjects in school provide students with fewer choices, leading them to hardly dig out their actual interests. For instance, a high school always teach   teenagers some normal lessons such as math, history, science, and so on. Meanwhile, students struggle in getting good scores in the examination and thus fail to explore the thing which matches their interests and talent. Therefore, it is reasonable that some people got a lower rank in school.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, society offers people more chance to seek their preferred job and career, which bring those who failed in their school life success. When people find things they are interested in, they tend to gain significant energy and self-satisfaction, making them take a giant step in life. Take finding a job as an example, people who are satisfied with their current job have a greater possibility of getting promoted and a big salary increment than those who lose interest in their job since they are willing to work hard in the company. Hence, people who get a favourite job and work in a suitable atmosphere tend to be successful.\r\n\r\nAlthough some factors are able to create success in people's life, I consider that gaining the favourite position is the most important thing to succeed in life"}
