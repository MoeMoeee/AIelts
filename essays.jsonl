What are the reasons for this? What could be done to solve this problem?", "content": "Due to increasing pressure and various other circumstances, children nowadays find it challenging to engage and concentrate on their academics at school. However, there are certain measures that can be taken to resolve this issue and make learning more fun and enjoyable for students. \r\n\r\nPrimarily, the lack of attention is due to the traditional teaching techniques followed by institutions. Passive teaching is sure to bore students rather than develop their talents since each student's grasping ability differs. The teachers are instructing students to memorise the answers instead of engaging in brainstorming and creative learning activities. The students rely on their memory and write the answer in the examination, which becomes the reason for frustration among the students. The use of portable devices such as mobile phones during lectures is another source of distraction. Instead of focusing on academics, students spend the majority of their time playing video games and surfing the internet. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, if instructors in schools use active learning techniques, in which each student is given the opportunity to exhibit what they have learned, students' learning will increase. Teachers should also use a variety of instructional strategies to pique students' interest and engagement, such as presenting videos, engaging through presentations, and personally contacting students. Finally, because distractions like video games and cell phones are the most prevalent cause of a child's lack of interest in studying, they should be banned in schools, and parents should impose a daily usage restriction on them. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, modern teaching techniques should be implemented in order to develop students' enthusiasm for learning and gadgets should be prohibited and limited because they tend to act as a barrier and reduce students' effectiveness"}

Thus, they can be less and less accessible to move in the rush hour. For example, an abundance of children have to eat junk food while they are stuck on the road, moreover, they spend their single hurry lives. So, to tackle this problem the government should pay  considerable attention to keeping their citizens free of housing trouble and they should prevent  mass transportation or business from being centred at a mere location. \r\n\r\nConsequently, to overcome this situation,  economic policy should play an important role to encourage  businesses to move to the rural area. Thus people living in other areas will enhance their quality of life because they are allowed to use more facilities such as shopping centres. Furthermore, an unbalanced financial will disappear since the merchant can make money from this investment. And for another, the spreading of the population can reduce  crime.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, from my perspective, this statement has more advantages than disadvantages. To counter these threats, not only the government but also the commerce should encourage the commercial everywhere."}

It is believed that a good teacher will make the students better. Teachers can be easily role models for their pupils. By being role models, teachers can shape the students' characters. Students will listen easily to their teachers. For instance, students become more diligent because they love to learn with their favourite teachers at school. As a result, students can achieve academic success easily.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the attitudes of students and their willingness plays an essential part to be successful in academic. Many people believe that attitude can show how far the students have learned. Moreover, the ability to answer teacher questions correctly means they learn seriously and regularly. These habits will shape them to become disciplined and responsible. It will help them to get better scores at school. For illustration, pupils that review their material at home will get a better understanding of that subject.

It will help people in more efficiently when bringing a thing during shopping.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some people who may not agree with this new payment method.

Although often debated, a major cause is due to the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food choices. In this essay, a look at these causes and their effects will be made.\r\n\r\n   Firstly, the two most major reasons for obesity are due to the unhealthy lifestyle and diets with a lack of nutrients trends in the 21st century. For instance, a study conducted by the American obesity society found that the fast meal industry market has increased doubled since the 2000s. It can easily be seen when people have busy daily lives, they towards to choose easy lunches and dinners with fast foods and microwavable diets, which contain much fat and sugar content. Moreover, people don\u2019t spend their time taking part in exercise in their daily lives. Thus, this lack of physical activities combined with processed food lead to  overweighting. \r\n\r\n   The effects of obesity are countless but a major one is that obesity leads to massive health problems. To illustrate, as evidenced in the United Kingdom, many scientists have pointed out that over 70 percent of fat people likely to face up with diseases such as heart failure, and diabetes, which are two of the leading causes of death. As a result, millions of dollars have been spent each year due to their diabetes and heart failure medications. Thus, it is clear that these effects need to be mostly decreased to reform the quality of life for future generations. \r\n\r\n   To conclude,  awareness and healthy food options, as well as, more social physical exercise are  significant ways to prevent  obesity. It is predicted that both schools and parents will encourage their children to have nourishing diets and follow  healthy lifestyle trends."}

Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "In today's world, obesity is becoming a big problem in many parts of the world. Recently, the number of obsessed people is increasing so fast that some suggest that, the main culprits like fast food and unhealthy food, needed to be taxed to discourage people from consuming too much. This essay will try to argue that increasing the price of junk food will not help people fight this obesity crisis.\r\n\r\nIn human history, obesity was never run rampant like this before. The obesity pandemic is a very modern problem, in the past, it is very hard to find poor people who were overweight in contrast to the present where most of the obsessed people come from low-income households. The main cause of this is that most of the time the only food these low-income people can afford is either low-quality and low-price fast food or heavily processed food that has low nutrition but high sugar and fat to compensate for the low-quality ingredient used to keep the price low. By levying the tax on junk food industries it will, in reality, make the problem much worse than it already is. If junk food increases in price then it will force people who can bearly afford to consume this already low-quality product to find the even lower-quality alternative.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, rather than put a tax on low-quality food it is better to spend money subsidizing or cutting taxes on healthy food options. If the root cause of obesity comes from overconsumption of low-quality consumption goods then the solution is to change the consumer choice. Since food is an essential part of life it is impossible to tell people to eat less expressly to those low-income who bearly scrape by even with low-cost fast food. Giving some incentives, like lowering taxes on healthier option products or subsidizing high-quality unprocessed ingredients, to fast food chains and food manufacturers to produce healthier products for the same price as the unhealthy product can help solve the overweight problem in the lower class who the most susceptible to the obesity pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion . For many people being obsessed didn't come from their personal choice but the lack of choices that cause them to resort to fattening food for sustenance. By giving those people a healthier affordable option, it will help them much more in the long term than to just increasing the prices of junk food which is their only option for food. And that is why I strongly disagree with increasing fast food prices as a solution to the obesity problem."}

In the meantime, there is some opinion that stands for the government needs to be focused on educating adults who need education instead of the youth. From my perspective, I completely agree with the statement that we government need to invest more in elder education. In this particular essay, I will elaborate the consideration of my views.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it needs to realize that number of education for adults could be low due to the limited access for them to pursue an education particularly in the previous decade with a minimum facility from the country, for instance in the rural area. Therefore, it leads them to the low opportunity for having a job that impacts their economy and they do not have enough money for their family. As an effect  As a result of this situation, they even can not they cannot afford to send their children to go to school. It will make the cycle of poverty in the family will revolves and perpetuate/continue/persist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if there is a public policy on enlarging the opportunity for education access for the elderly. For example, an education to develop soft skills such as Reading, Basic Mathematics, and Basic Digital or Information Technology Education it will help them to broaden their competencies and can give them new skills which can be used for them to apply for a job since the opportunity to them will rise up because of the competencies that they have. Their life will be better than before, and they can fulfill their family\u2019s primary needs because of the cash that they get from their jobs. This policy also can help to decrease the poverty number in the country.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is important for the government in investing the elder\u2019s education access to help them have a good life for their family and so on. In addition, an opportunity for adults in getting knowledge can impact the country\u2019s development in the case of poverty as well."}

In this essay, therefore, the reasons and the opinions will be discussed and the following example will be provided in order to support my point of view.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that novelists and TV producers are attracting the reader and  viewers by exaggerating suspense scenes. From this sentence I will concentrate more on the TV shows that had a massive impact on people's imaginations because the producer utilises technological methods to attract them and make them feel curious, so they want to know more about what is happening next. Moreover, some stories are related to real life. For example, a couple lovers had been killed by a mysterious guy or stories about unbelievable massive accidents all around the world by well know scientists. Having said that, the entertainment from curious crime stories had  attracted more people to watch or read them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believed that entertainment cush as films about crime dramas can have a major effect in different ways. For instance, mature will enjoy and learn from the movie that situations or circumstances might be happening so they will realise and be more different themself when it happens. However, children or less mature people might think that violence from TV is normal and they may manipulate it because they think humans from TV shows can do, so they can do the same as well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, crime stories are popular and increasingly more viewers  watch  films. therefore, parents must supervise their children about pros and cons of  crime stories."}

To develop it further, travel agents have utilized all their means to create new experiences. But in the process, there have been some hot debates about whether or not commercializing cultural traditions is a sensible decision. In my opinion, both views have their legitimate reasons.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the continuous expansion of tourism has several consequences. The first negative effect is that heritage sites and monuments are jam-packed with tourists, causing damage to them. For instance, the influx of tourists in the ancient town of Hoi An carved their names on the walls, which vandalized the historical landmark. Moreover, the uncontrolled development of tourism can deteriorate the environment and threaten wildlife. A simple example is Nha Trang beach with garbage floating all over its coast, causing loss of scenery, water pollution, and harm to marine life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some argue that putting a price on cultural tours is the only method to keep them from fading away. First, revenue from sightseeing, art performances, and other tourist activities is used largely for restoration efforts. Without enough financial support, various attraction sites may fall into disrepair. Another reason is that tourism helps promote cultural exchange. Tourists can visit many historical significance places and talk to local people to gain an in-depth understanding about the area's culture. This encourages the revival of traditions and elevates cultural values.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is beyond doubt that developing tourism brings both positive and negative impacts. Governments and authorities should not lose sight of this fact before deciding on expanding the tourism industry."}

I think advantages are more than disadvantages. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, employment opportunities are increased because of  the establishment of big companies. They need more well-educated people to run different businesses. As well as appoint less experience communities in different positions ,for example, janitorial staff, and cafeteria staff. The second benefit is eligible people get an opportunity to prove themselves through their work and share their skills with other people, who have less experience. For example; if the person who works as an accountant has an issue solving problem related to Social issues, he or she can get help from the other person who has experience in the Social field. The third benefit is to contribute to the development of the country because we all know that business reflects the economy of the country. Big companies have approached to settle down their relations with other countries. For example, business partnerships with other companies.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, with the development of multi-national companies people get attracted and start to ignore private businesses for example; people start  buying vegetables and all household items from the grocery store rather than street vendors so the street vendors feel helpless and shut down their business. Secondly, life will be harder for illustrate people because they do not have the basic education and resources which they require to run big companies as compared to educated people. for instance; an educated person can run any kind of business but a person who has no knowledge of business survives in poverty.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Overall big companies provide better opportunities for employment as well as better future options."}

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "It is considered that increasing the supply of some famous consumable item which was actually not in demand can be achieved with the influence of advertisement. I completely agree with this concept because an interesting presentation creates curiosity and most people fall for it despite the real cost-benefit-need analysis. In this essay, we will see how it works with some examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly,  advertisements create an interactive interface in a person's mind and when they are interesting and relevant by any means induce desire. In my hometown, people are fond of making a special sweet called Khasta as it is a household name and included in everyday meals. Citizens use traditional equipment made of wood to shape it as shaping with hands is tedious and time-consuming. A famous Kitchen utensil manufacturer developed the same device out of steel and brought it into the market but was unsuccessful. Then they began advertising after 3 years of product lunch and soon their sales tripled the following year. But soon the habitats realized that the sweet was missing in taste, texture and durability. \r\n\r\nLater, after numerous consumer complaints, the local government began to investigate. when the inspection was completed it was found that there was no problem with the manufacturer's equipment but it was the wood which rich the taste. The report says  it was the specific wood which has a unique compound called \"bibi\" in the local language which adds flavour to the sweet and was responsible for the preservation for a longer duration whereas the steel lacks that. Moreover, the tree was locally inhabited so the multinational manufacturer had no knowledge about it. They found that the product is very popular in other states however so, it would be an easy go, it did but did not prolong.\r\n\r\nOverall, the power of advertisement does increase sales in the market where there is no demand but how long the demand lasts is completely dependent on the consumer.

The governments have taken some measures at a global level. But they got only few solutions. Why is it so? How can this be solved?", "content": "Pollution and climate change are going up every day. Moreover, governments are offering solutions that are not effective on a worldwide scale. In this essay, I will explain the reasons behind this and provide some potential solutions.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the world now to 100 years ago, we can identify the problem. In the past, people lived in rural areas and consumed what they grew. However, after the industrial revolution, more communities migrated to cities and their habits shifted from being producers to consumers. Companies now strive to sell their products in order to increase their wealth, and governments do not have the authority to limit them, so even in developed countries this problem remained as it was. Additionally, the media industry and the internet assist companies in reaching customers worldwide. Resulting in increased use of fossil fuel products delivery. For instance, wooden types of furniture can produce in any country, but for the sake of advertisements, imported type is used.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is the encouragement of excessive consumption. In the past one car was sufficient for a family, but now it has become common for each person to own their own car. With the increasing human population on Earth, the need for food is undeniable. As a result, organizations are employing conservation and other production techniques to produce and store food for longer periods of time or cutting trees of jungles to build construction for industrial reasons. However, this leads to the use of more industrial machines, facilities and pesticides in agriculture. While there are benefits to these practices, associations often use excessive amounts of water and pollute it before returning to nature. For example, in my country, one of the most well-known companies is a major contributor to water pollution as they release dirty water into rivers, and the government cannot do anything about it.\r\n\r\nIn summary, these changes are inevitable, but humans are accelerating them. The only way to slow down these changes is by teaching people to love the Earth like other creatures in the world."}

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "In today\u2019s interconnected world environmental pollution especially, four-wheelers are causes great damage to our planet in multiple ways, and to reduce this, Government should create a policy or a strategy of bringing electric transportation which is proven to efficient. I agree with the above-mentioned statement. Electric cars are more eco-friendly, and people can save money on petrol.\r\n\r\nFirstly, electric cars are environmentally friendly. Moreover, they don\u2019t produce any kind of pollution which would affect our planet besides, they don\u2019t need any kind of fuel to run. Therefore, they contribute to lower air pollution. Additionally, this kind of transport operates more quietly than traditional cars, reducing noise pollution. Hence, helps combat climate change and improve air quality. For example, instead of using traditional cars for those who deliver products to nearby areas such as Pizza, groceries, and other petty companies, promoting electric cars for deliveries can save enormous savings to them.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these types of vehicles bring cost savings. As we discussed, in the first paragraph, they have lower operating cost compared to petrol cars, they are more predictable and non-fluctuating like petrol prices. Furthermore, the maintenance cost is very less, and their wear and tear are less frequent compared to other cars. Besides, we can have our own solar charger installed at home, and no need to go outside for charging the car. For example, Governments around the world offer rebates and incentives or grants to promote the adoption of these vehicles. Therefore, taking these advantages can bring significant cost savings.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, yes, I strongly agree that banning petrol and diesel cars would benefit and as mentioned above EVs are the most eco-friendly, improve air quality and reduce noise pollution. Additionally, they bring long-term cost savings too."}

What is the cause of this? What are some possible solutions?", "content": "It is needless to enlighten, today's world has modernized a lot compared to the old era. New technologies and developments have drastically changed the living style that can be observed evitably in our forefathers and current community. The latest innovations like smartphones, tablets, and other electronic gadgets are a nightmare for elderly people, they encounter troubles while dealing with modern machines. This essay will outline some causes being faced by old folks while using advanced machinery and solutions to curb this menace.\r\n\r\nThere are myriad reasons related to the problems of past generations in handling technological devices. First and foremost is unawareness of recent advancements. People from previous decades had limited resources and knowledge. There were not enough facilities available for them to learn and research about changes in the world, and the media was also restricted to certain areas only. Besides, technology itself not being mature compared to what it is in the day. For example, only a few people have smartphones equipped with very limited features. As a result, the old folks could not have opportunities to come in contact with a variety of technological development causing troubles for them in today's innovative nature. Another reason for the stated problem is the old generation's lack of information, literacy plays a vital role in human development. Because of poor education resources and limited investigation departments at the global level in the early 90s, the Elderly society spent most of its time hard working. For instance, conquering the moon was beyond the imagination. However, analysis blocks like NASA, Space X,  and many others around the world had achieved this milestone.\r\n\r\nThus, limited resources along with research centres, poor education systems, and unawareness of advancement were the main problematic areas for our forefathers in handling new technologies.\r\n\r\nThere are colossal ways and means that can be taken for its remedy. Firstly, the young generation has a pivotal role to deal with this problem. They should spend some of their time with their grandparents regularly to make them aware of the latest technologies like smartphones, and tablets and guide them about the benefits it has brought into our lives. In addition to that higher authorities should establish awareness centres, especially for old people where they can learn about modern innovation and also the usage of electronic gadgets.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, indeed, the old generation usually is not updated about the latest innovations and developments. However, individuals and authorities should put their best foot forward by introducing awareness campaigns & programs for modern technology. Whereas the young generation should also spend time with their grandparents at home to guide them about the use of the latest electronic equipment."}

In my opinion, firmly agree with the notion because excessive use is harmful to humans and also animals. I will discuss the effects of fossil fuels in the ensuing paragraphs. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are numerous negative effects of the usage of fossil fuels. The combustion of gas produces a toxic substance of carbon dioxide which directly affects living creatures and causing of climate change. The weather these days is unpredictable because of climate change. Moreover, ozone depletion creates a cause of climate change. In other words, UV rays are direct reflect on the Earth which leads to skin cancer in the human body.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the international community promote  all  nations to reduce the usage of fossil fuels because the prominent reason that  is non-renewable energy or fuels in the near future,  will be extinct. Hence, these authorities suggest that find alternative options instead of fossil fuels. For example, the prime mister of India promotes electrical vehicles which save non-renewable energy. The survey by the Environment Department predicted that in Saudi Arabia, the production of gasoline and oil would decline in 2025 and the country no longer be able to export.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main cause of air pollution which creates by non-renewable sources. Consequently, all countries must work together to prevent the further depletion of fossil fuels and find alternative ways."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "In this modern era, there is a conflict regarding household duties as men and women both have to divide the chores equally among them. It is quite significant to notice that  women are the backbone of their families so there should be some equality and justice for them also. I totally agree with this statement that the job at home should be proportionally divided among both which will be discussed further in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, in earlier times only the males were the breadwinner for the family, however, nowadays, both  genders are working equally to earn for the family. Therefore, both should task together on the household schedule instead of throwing a woman in the kitchen after those long hours of working outside. For instance, they can divide the work according to their interest or also for odd-even days which will give a kind of relief to a woman too. Not only that, females are the ones who take care of their children. Nevertheless, makes are equal parents of the child so they should also take care of them by investing time in their study or play. \r\n\r\nMoving further, women are physically not that much stronger than men, then what is the logic behind forcing them to task alone at home? Unfortunately, ladies are considered as labour force so they are supposed to work the whole day no matter what is their strength as compared to another gender. Even though they are the ones who suffer from the natural cycle each month but who cares. Instead of making them suffer from all these situations, men as well as society have to understand their condition and let them work proportionally at home as compared to men.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, males and ladies should be considered equal in every hemisphere and if it is about working at the house then they should divide the chores equally. Females are also working outside with men to run the family and they are contributing equally as well. So instead of being physically and emotionally ,weaker they are taking care of household chores which should be divided same among them."}

Some people believe that due to this, many parts of the world will encounter a global crisis. Others feel that population is needed for boosting the economy of any country and society. This essay will elucidate both views with relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, various areas of the world face a crisis of basic amenities due to scarcity of resources and overcrowding. This is possibly due to underdevelopment and a nonproductive workforce. For example, a region's growth is directly proportional to the intelligent and smart youth. If they are not fruitful, they will not grow to the intended level.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many developed countries require genius people to take care of many firms they have come up with. Moreover, it is of paramount importance that companies do well in terms of production that can be sent to those needy to fetch a reasonable amount of money. For instance, a country producing abundant amounts of grains can be exported to those where it is intensely short of it. This could be due to unfavourable conditions in the country that prevent them from cultivating it. Hence, they rely on getting them imported. To do all these in a sophisticated manner, sensible manpower is required.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I would say overcrowding could be a question  when it comes to managing the population ; however, it is very essential to have accountable people to take care of the developed things within to ensure well earning.\r\n\r\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android"}

In my opinion, such a type of labour law will stop exploitation and will have a positive impact on the workers.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons behind the long working duties. Mainly, the invention of new technologies keeps employees busy even after their daily office time.For example, it is too easy to be in touch with your clients through notifications on the smartphone or e-mail. It is mandatory for some higher-level person to reply to it. Secondly, during industrial, expansion  employers take advantage of needy employees and push them to work for 12-14 hours as a slave, and if they deny they may suffer from job loss or maybe  financial issues.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the limited working time law offers a worker to have a mental, physical and social pace. Like, factory workers hardly get moments to spend with their families as they suppose to stay on the same premise after long duties. The limited engagement of work will help them to spend a good time with their family which leads to strong family life. To continue, in such countries where there are no rules of labour time forces too manpower in physical exploitation especially with child labour.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the need for laws related to controlling working hours occurs because of new inventions and unlimited greed. By introducing, law it becomes easy to develop both a mental and social environment in the country by considering its own perspective."}

However, these vehicles lead to some environmental problems such as air pollution, global warming, climate change and so on. Therefore, people need a comprehensive plan to address the results of using vehicles. Some cities have vehicle-free days to promote the use of public transport. In my opinion, despite some obvious drawbacks which should not be overlooked, I think the benefits of a vehicle-free day outweigh.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of using public transport should be taken into consideration. The major benefit of using public transport which should be initially referred to is that people can be more healthy and problems in the field of environment reduce sharply. Vehicle pollutants harm our health and contain greenhouse gases that cause climate change. If people are unaware of climate change possibility, they will face its results which are famine, drought, and flooding. For instance, a survey found that more than 45% of people living in cities which are not used public transport have more risk to be asthma and breathing difficulties because of toxic gases.\r\n\r\nAnother significant advantage of using public transport is that it helps to protect nonrenewable energy resources which as oil. Due to the ever-increasing number of people, nonrenewable energy resources reduce dramatically. However, people need these energy resources because they are energy-rich and relatively cheap to process. For this reason, thanks to vehicle-free days, people can be aware of the detrimental effects of oil consumption.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, vehicle-free days are beneficial to prevent mentioned above adverse effects of using private vehicles."}

First of all, It is evident to everybody that working conditions have become more complicated, and this situation has led to confined employees to their job in order to keep their job secure. Furthermore, life expenses have become a principal dilemma among folks. They should afford the cost of rent, installments, or even unforeseen expenses like disease treatment.

For instance, employers can offer some promotions based on employees' competency. Employers can consider a program for employees in which they can raise their salary if they have some proposals in order to enhance company income. On the other hand, employers can consider a break time for rest each hour or even provide some gaming counselors in order to have moments of tranquility and vitality with colleagues. Therefore, there are several opportunities that employers can offer to cease employees' mental issues.\r\n\r\nTo draw a conclusion, it should be reiterated that even though financial barriers are an inseparable dilemma in this hectic life, employers could act as a vital role in alleviating this detrimental disorder."}

While  the old generation has a lack of problems using it. Because  In past decades people were doing every work with hand made. They all have conversations with each other through  letters and posts. But, At present era totally changed so, There is a number of technical devices available for every work. Such as smartphones, Laptops, Androids Leds.

In this essay, I will outline arguments for and against the method of study and I will state my viewpoint on this issue.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the majority of people are convinced that it provides positive impacts for pupils to do group-based study at school. To express it more plainly, the shared study approach motivates students to take part in discussions and find  solutions by brainstorming with one another which really makes the study process fun and interesting. Not only are the students encouraged to be more active, but also they learn teamwork as well as other social skills. To give an instance, Although some courses were too boring and tedious for me during university, I found out that by collaborative learning with other students, I can make them too entertaining and get good grades as group study avoid us to be tired.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some individuals who opine that it is advantageous for students to study lonely. To put it another way, they believe that pupils must be able to analyze  scientific subjects alone to learn  problem-solution skills. For instance, some surveys and research showed that students who sued to study alone usually have better capabilities to come up with difficulties and are able to control hard situations. Moreover, they can be better tutors in future too. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, both methods are advantageous for students provided that they opt for one of the correct methods regarding their interests and the characteristics of the courses.

I entirely agree with this statement due to the increasing amount of gas emissions and decreasing green spaces that I will discuss in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirst, the growth of globalization makes it easier for people to travel anywhere and anytime; however, it can effect the environment due to the increasing amount of gas emissions. Most people prefer to commute by using their private vehicles or an airplane if they go aboard. As a consequence, using those transport modes can result in gas emissions, which can destroy our environment. For example, the top executive managers in big companies who have several offices in different countries will use airplanes and private cars when they have meeting agendas in different locations. These vehicles produce much more gas emissions when they travel frequently, which will affect our environment. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the expansion of multinational companies also has an effect on the environment, especially our green spaces, which are decreasing. When multinational companies will expand their businesses or factories in other places, it directly affects the green ecosystem environment, which is decreasing in forest and woodland areas. The natural balance is also disturbed. For instance, Nestle company has several branch offices and factories in various countries, and this takes up a lot of land in many countries. As a result, green spaces are decreasing as this company continues to expand its businesses and factories in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that globalization and the increasing number of multinational companies have a negative effect on the environment due to the fact that increasing gas emissions and green space issues."}

Others, However, think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "In the present time, individuals around the world take the view that routine is preferable to any changes. In contrast, others believe that change has a beneficial role in our lives. The objective of this essay is to discuss both of this and give my own perspective with relevant examples in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo embark with, many people avoid changes because they might like being stable without unnecessary changes. For instance, people who want to spend their lives  pursuing a single career path without any promotions. Moreover, one of the reasons why individuals tend to do this due to their fear and  not being willing to take a risk. Such risks as losing a job or hatred from colleagues. This is the most habitual for the Japanese population. Their cultural beliefs and traditions do not allow such behaviour where workers ask for a promotion. It is thought to be rude by the Japanese society. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others advocate that changes are important and always have positive effects on a person and his surroundings. In other words, without change individuals can not reach their pinnacle and aim. Also, it was proven by scientists that a person who tends to change has  more changes to stay mentally health. That is because when people expand their knowledge and learn about new activities which are unusual for them, the brain  activates neurons to cope with difficulties. Therefore, these actions are connected with human change by implication. As a result, change has a positive impact on individuals' development and mental health. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are two opinions, those who appreciate change and those who do not. Change has an important function in developing the brain and personality. However, some societies do not prefer change due to their culture and tradition.  From my own perspective, change matters, and being flexible is much more important nowadays than ever."}

Subsequently, almost 60% of the moisture is dehydrated by Withering the tea leaves on a rack.Next, the leaves can be processed by the novel method where the leaves are cut, torn and curled, and this results in a more efficient way of producing small granular bits in tea bags. In comparison, the conventional methodology results in loose tea leaflets, by Rolling them flat and breaking them,  which causes the release of enzymes.\r\n\r\nAfter this, both kinds of by-products are subjected to Fermentation or Oxidation respectively, where the tea leaves are spread on cement or on tiles which is done in order to ensure that the enzymes react with air to produce a richer copper colour. Finally, they undergo Firing or Drying either in ovens or in air dryers ensuring 97% of the moisture content is lost, owing to the enriched aroma as well as flavour that is experienced on drinking black tea."}

This essay will discuss both views and why I think it is essential to mingle with others.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, parents choose to let their children carry out free time activities on their own to develop independence. When children work independently, they acquire skills that will be useful for their future such as being able to solve problems. Furthermore, not having to spend time with a lot of people allows them to avoid disagreements with friends. Children find it easier to play online games than to go out to the park. Therefore, parents desire their children to stay home and do what they love on their own.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, research indicates that collaboration between young children enhances social and confidence skills. First, as young youths do things with their mates, they develop good communication skills by initiating and contributing to conversations. Hence, in future when they are young adults, they are prepared to face the challenges that come with working with different people. For example, as they participate in group settings, they become capable communicators and learn from other people's perspectives. Secondly, spending time with peers' supports the development of confidence. This is achieved when youths share ideas and extend on them, as a result, they build on their self-esteem knowing that their thoughts are valued. Therefore,  it is important that children should get out of their comfort zone and meet people to strengthen life's essential skills such as social and confidence skills.\r\n\r\nIn summary, some people think children should spend time on their own, while others think they should socialise. I think the latter is essential because it helps with skills for social life and confidence."}

Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local people  to visit this historical  sites and museums?", "content": "It is true that most historical sites and museums attract a larger number of tourists; however, local people are less interested. In my opinion, there are numerous reasons for this trend. I will discuss the reason and also give a solution in the ensuing paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, people are bored visiting such places. In other words, local citizens know about their own cities therefore, it is not new for them. Hence, they think that such visits are a waste of time. However, tourists are very excited to explore new things in their destinations. Museums and  historical sites will help to understand the history and culture of the countries they visit. Another reason is that these types of places tickets are very expensive. If people visited once that they would not pay the higher entrance fees.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are several solutions to these situations. Firstly, the government should organise campaigns to attract the local public such as free education seminars, health care camps and other programs which will attract. Moreover, the authority of such places gives extra discounts or is free for locals. So that, low and middle-income families can visit. For example, schools or colleges give assignments to the student related to history and they interact with historical places. Lastly, the organisation give more and more job opportunity to the local public. Hence, they work in such places and pursue more knowledge about history.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the government can encourage more locals by running interesting programs such as exhibits at these locations and offering free or subsidized entry."}

Governments should embargo the sale of bottled water.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?.", "content": "It is argued by some individuals that government should restrict the sale of bottled water as water is a natural resource, and it should always be free of cost. However, I have a complete disagreement with this notion \r\n\r\nTo begin with, I believe free water facilities should only be free for people in public places, remote areas, or slum areas so that people can get clean, drinkable water free of charge. For example, in Indian villages and public places, railway stations, parks, and bazaars, clear tap water is viable for residents.  But, for residential or commercial use in cities or towns, For instance, in India, city authorities charge monthly water bills for water supplies. This method has discouraged civilians from wasting water. Nevertheless, some years ago, when tap water was free, per capita water utilization was considerably higher in urban areas.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the sale of bottled water is increasing significantly across the world and there are some specific reasons why  it should not be banned. Firstly, before packing water in bottles, it is properly purified so that it does impact the consumers. In other words, water purification standards are met by companies becoming water bottled, while in some countries, like India, Public tap water is too polluted and can cause health issues hence people avoid even free water and prepared packed water for drinking. Secondly, the suggestion of banning packed water would not be accepted by companies and the government would face agitation, if they go for implementing it. Because this decision will adversely impact the earnings of the bottled water business. Hence it is practically impossible to stop the sales of bottled water.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I believe that government should not put restrictions on the sale of bottled water and even it is difficult to impossible to make it free for every individual."}

To live a happy and successful life in a world where the majority of adolescents remain indoors after school or spend the majority of their time on mobile devices or viewing television, thereby negatively affecting their health, is to engage in some form of athletic activity. Group sports teach them how to collaborate in a club setting.In addition, they have the opportunity to develop leadership abilities by serving as team leaders.Lastly, how to motivate team members in low morale situations and maintain team coordination. In a recent survey conducted by the sports council of India, it was found that teenagers who perform sports concurrently with their education have greater stamina, focus, and concentration than their peers.\r\n\r\nOpponents of group sports, on the other hand, argue that there is no need for group sports because it is a waste of time that could be spent on the academic front.Then, sometimes the leader always receives recognition for the team's overall performance, and talented youths are never given the opportunity to advance.In addition, they lose their study focus and spend the majority of their time performing sports.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after weighing the pros and cons, I am of the opinion that club sports are crucial to the success of children's careers and that they should participate in some form of physical activity."}

It is always a topic of discussion whether images are effective in comparison with written information or not. I will discuss this and share my opinion in the following paragraphs about these two factors.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, pictures portray a detailed explanation. For instance, a recent study of a few Indian neurologists organized a free analysis of the young generation. Under that, a few youngsters were shown certain historical images and others were given scriptures for the same pictures after a couple of hours, a few questions were asked of both groups to test them, and they found unimaginable data. Those who were shown images, were able to recall most of the data and were clear with what they saw under images, compared to 2nd group who were only able to remember a few things.    \r\n\r\nSecondly, compared to written or visual, a shot can bring more attention and better understanding.  \r\n\r\nAnother study, which is recently published by WHO scientist Roger Federer showed that humans are more capable of remembering pictures or videos compared to written information. After hearing this data, the Indian government has decided to change the way of educating and most prominently the small kids by adding more pictures & videos along with less written information in their syllabus because it is really easy to make children understand the facts and figures.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, images and drawings are more productive than written data, furthermore, this is really important to have great memories and keep humans grateful."}

From my perspective, I totally concur with this tendency, as it provides multiple benefits, especially in violence and crime rates, besides some other methods to ensure people's life and health. All of them will be clarified thoroughly through this essay.\r\n\r\nInitially, it is undeniable that guns, when being used by crime elements, ranging from thieves, robbers, gangsters, murder and so on,  become a bad thing, which put a higher risk in citizens whenever they leave their houses. Moreover, owning weapons as a defence method sometimes motivate peoples to choose violent ways when facing any issues. For instance, accommodating guns while having troubles when people's brains become impressively angry and unconscious can lead to regretful consequences, as many investigators have pointed out that people are inclined to solve problems due to their emotions more than their minds.\r\n\r\nBesides several reasons for prohibiting  bringing guns everywhere in towns, there are many substituted methods to replace this. Firstly, there should be more investment in security guards and safety management. Gaining people's trust is often seen as a more effective and feasible way to protect human life. Secondly, raising people's awareness through some propaganda classes and educating people in the right way might help to solve this issue.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it will be dangerous for people and others to carry guns whenever hanging out.

Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages", "content": "These days, as a result of the advent of technology in food making industry, a huge range of fast food become easily available and accessible to anyone. This, may include under-age people. Although there might be some benefits of the massive availability of fast meals, I believe that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\nTo embark on, it is true that many working parents nowadays are dependent on processed food for preparing daily meals for their families. The reason for this is that processed foods are easy to be prepared and also taste good. As a result, these parents will have more time to do other important jobs or errands. However, studies show that consuming an excessive amount of junk food has an appalling effect on our bodies. First, fast foods or processed foods have been processed through several steps before it served to the consumers. This means that essential nutrients are already cooked away and gone. This will be particularly dangerous for children as they may not receive the nutrients necessary for their growth. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, fast food contains a high levels of fats, calories and sugar that negatively affect our body in the long term.

This figure increased in 1990 but decreased declined by 5% in the last year.

I think that finding a favourite job is the key to success, which directly causes this situation mentioned before. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we have to recognize that customized subjects in school provide students with fewer choices, leading them to hardly dig out their actual interests. For instance, a high school always teach   teenagers some normal lessons such as math, history, science, and so on. Meanwhile, students struggle in getting good scores in the examination and thus fail to explore the thing which matches their interests and talent. Therefore, it is reasonable that some people got a lower rank in school.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, society offers people more chance to seek their preferred job and career, which bring those who failed in their school life success. When people find things they are interested in, they tend to gain significant energy and self-satisfaction, making them take a giant step in life. Take finding a job as an example, people who are satisfied with their current job have a greater possibility of getting promoted and a big salary increment than those who lose interest in their job since they are willing to work hard in the company. Hence, people who get a favourite job and work in a suitable atmosphere tend to be successful.\r\n\r\nAlthough some factors are able to create success in people's life, I consider that gaining the favourite position is the most important thing to succeed in life"}
