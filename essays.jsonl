This means that  employers call for being more talented in socialisation and being strongly educated. In my opinion, having social skills are more vital compared to good qualifications in this century. In this essay, what are the benefits of being social in business competition will be explained in the coming paragraph with a logical conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the last 2 decades have witnessed bizarre circumstances in some companies. People who work to choose employment forget to be stigmatised when they make a core decision. They believe that candidates who have a huge network suit  this position. For example, getting a job in countries which have an awful economy (including Turkiye, Bulgaria, and Macedonia) is so tough as you need to have close ties like family members. Hence, many people who have a high educational level might be unemployed with this inequality. This could be seemed notas  a social skill, however, it really high-level  interaction skill according to these poor countries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some researchers point out that introverted people with good qualifications are struggling to find work. Because  a lack of communication skills promotes showing their talents in their own subject. Therefore, this situation chips away at their self-confidence and they could be more asocial than before. Businesses are a sea, and this sea is becoming more and more deeper for people who have social anxiety.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, both qualification and socialisation are significant to be in a race with competitors. Nevertheless,the advantage of having a good bridge with others outweigh the benefit of being educated. I hope  this issue will be fixed by the governments in the future and people might assess via equal standards."}

It is our basic need. Some minds claim that a place for living for people who are unable to afford a house should be offered by the government, however, others claim that it should not be provided by the government. I firmly agree with the former notion because of many reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost is that for the protection of the individuals in the country, it is the duty of the authority to provide a free place for the impoverished to live in which shows the positive attitude of management for the people. To illustrate, there are countries such as Canada, India and many more that are providing free-of-cost houses for underprivileged families. Secondly, caring for local people is the duty of authority and by doing this, people will believe that the government is taking care of its residents.\r\n\r\nMoving further, the count of death and disease will be reduced when all people have homes as it protects us from extreme weather conditions such as heat, snow storms, cold, rain and many more. For example, people who don't have a home because of money,  have to live on streets or roads which will prone them to get diseases or a reason for death as well. Furthermore, others will also follow this plan so their residents don't have any trouble living in the country.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there is no doubt free housing will affect the budget of government but owing to a number of reasons to provide homes without money to impoverished nationals such as the safety and security of the population, the positive attitude of the country towards its citizens and the harmony of the nation."}

As humans, we have progressed a long way creating bridges for communication among various tribes. As an avid learner of languages, it is essential to understand the country's culture and its people's lifestyle. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, we will discuss two important points that demonstrate without exploring the details of the origin of a language; it's challenging to comprehend the correct form.\r\n\r\nIf we talk about ancient languages - signs and symbols used by our ancestors, the stone age people, it's fundamental to understand their lifestyle and culture. For instance, it would be difficult to transfer the knowledge they gained and carve on stones without understanding how they live and what they do. In fact, the stone painting would be all gibberish if we failed to understand their civilization and way of living.\r\n\r\nIf we talk about modern vocabulary, they all have idioms to express situations in phrases. For example, raining cats and dogs - a situation in the past when after heavy rainfall, all the poor helpless creatures die because of floods. Failing to learn the origin of idioms, we will struggle to use them correctly, hence failing to use the language correctly. Moreover,  grammar used in the language is deeply rooted in the culture and lifestyle of the people of any nation. Such as, in Hindi, every noun has a gender; to use it correctly, you must understand the culture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we discussed how culture and lifestyle profoundly impact the language spoken throughout the country. I agree with this statement without a second thought."}

To what extend do you agree or disagree?", "content": "the staff is pivotal to the success of any job. to achieve job progression, one must possess strong social skills in addition to work experience. given that work and communication are interdependent with each other, I firmly believe that social skills and qualifications are equally essential for job success. \r\n\r\nin a workplace, social skills are crucial for successful teamwork. they allow individuals to work effectively with each other, share and discuss ideas, practice creativity, resolve conflicts, and form a positive work environment. besides, it helps alleviate work stress. taking a break from work to socialize with colleagues and connect can provide mental and physical refreshment, and promote work-life balance.  also, in order to strengthen the relationship with other employees traits like empathy, compassion, respect, and honesty are as vital as other mentioned skills. skills like these help an individual cope in the real world, which an academic degree does not offer. \r\n\r\nif the recruitment process is only focused on the qualification of an individual, then it results in hiring employees who are inadequate to show effective work results due to their lack of social skills. candidates with poor social skills often struggle to adapt to new environments, engage in teamwork, voice their ideas or concern, cooperate with others, and maintain a healthy relationship. these people often feel helpless and are hesitant to ask for help. As a result, they are easily agitated and unsuccessful to increase their productivity. actions like these hinders work advancement and lower the company's reputation. consequently, they are either fired from their jobs or transferred to another sector. \r\n\r\nundoubtedly, academic qualifications are also important because despite having essential social skills, one will fail inevitably if one does not have the required skills to solve a problem. qualifications indicate a person's education level and how much depth a person's knowledge has. it most definitely helps a recruiter in hiring suitable candidates. \r\n\r\nto conclude, the mentioned advantage of social skills helps a person to grow confident in their work and progress. in the modern era, more people are coming to this realization and putting equal weight on possessing social skills in addition to having good academic qualifications."}

While it has brought forward the biggest revolution in the form of the internet, on the other hand, it has provided us with different machines that have made many of our day-to-day tasks easy. However, there is a general perception that it has made people forget about some basic life skills . In  the following paragraphs, I would like to shed some light on the bases of such thoughts.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, as we all know  technology has made our lives easier in many ways and humans have worked hard for years to acquire this all. For example, we have now automated washing machines and dishwasher present in our homes that can do the work in minutes for us without any hassle. So. basically in my view, it is only about utilising the best facilities and it is not in any way related to laziness or lack of skills. Individuals are just thriving to save their time , so they can invest it in the  better side but a lot of personages from old generation regarded it as a lack of interest in life skills.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the internet has opened many new doors for learning and mastering new techniques of all types. For instance, girls can cook from easy cooking videos and teachers can get ideas for many artworks. Students can take online lectures and online workshops that can help them in mastering many skills.  Therefore, instead of making individuals lazy and raw, it is actually polishing them in the long run\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it can be concluded with full confidence that advancement has literally brought the best for us. Now, it is our responsibility to use it for a positive impact and avoid any misuse. We should also try to learn not to be always dependent on anything but we should make the most of the facilities we have now."}

They start living on their own or sharing a home with friends. Do you agree or disagree with this approach. Give your opinion.", "content": "Young children in developed countries have the mentality to live separately from their parent's homes as soon as they have finished school. Many of them decide to live alone whereas, some of them choose to live in a dwelling with mates. I strongly disagree with this advancement. This essay will explain the differences along with my perspective in the upcoming paragraphs. \r\n\r\nTo commence with, privacy is one of the major concerns of young children by leaving their homes at a very young age. They believe that they are mature enough to take decisions. They think that their parents have no right to rule their life. Moreover, differences between the parents will push them to live separately. For example, Toronto is one of the high-profile cities in Canada, 98 % of youth in Toronto city live alone. Governments of such countries allow children to work part-time after the age of 18. Therefore, they get the opportunity to work and handle expenses on their own.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, affection is another reason that children are unable to leave their homes. They get attached to their family, as they lived more than 16 years over there. It is hard to leave your parents and start everything in a new way. For example, according to a doctor's theory, parents are the only stable need of a child that will last forever in his whole life. Thus, living by self is optional, but moving from a family is a big responsibility for a child to tackle everything alone.\r\n\r\nI opine that parents present their role very effectively. It is their child's duty to settle down things when they get matured. They sacrifice their whole life to nourish their children, leaving them, at last,last is not the right choice.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, millions of positive points will not hide the drawbacks of living alone or settling things on their own."}

Does this development have more advantages or disadvantages?", "content": "Nowadays, many companies have developed computer systems and created working robots for multiple purposes. Some people believe that this technology may help them to work effectively, while some people argue that there are many negative effects of programming robots which do more jobs instead of humans. Not only this essay will explain the benefits and drawbacks of this development, but it also supports that this technology should not replace human jobs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, artificial intelligence programs will support many companies, such as food industries and hardware manufacturers. Programming robots may work faster than human at a constant rate, and this lead to more productivity for companies. Moreover, programming machines may keep the product quality. For example, the food industry has been using robots to prepare their frozen products, which can keep the quality of the size of cutting meat, and provide the constant speed of processing. Although this technology may develop robots to help many industries, there are more tasks that can not replace by machines.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many fields have some robotics to be used as their support, but robots cannot do many creative works, critical thinking skills, and hands-on procedures. During this new development, there are many companies have been using robots to create artwork, but the result is not satisfactory yet. Therefore, the style of art may copy from other artists and lack creativity. Furthermore, some people try to use robots in medical fields, including helping doctors diagnose the disease, but they still lack the accuracy to understand the complications. Many practical skills are required for specialists to do these works.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, using robots will be helpful in many ways, such as for mass production and standard manufacturing. While programming robots can help many companies, creative works and medical fields are required humans to do these tasks. This essay provides the idea that there are more disadvantages to this development."}

Personally, I am not totally agree with this idea and this essay will discuss my point of view in the following paragraphs, including some examples from my own experience.\r\n\r\nAt the outset, nowadays,  business is considered one of the most famous and prospering types of work, as well as qualifications on business administration is growing day by day. Most people are striving to have own occupation because of its convenience and flexibility. Even the graduates change their career direction to business administrartion if they are dissatisfied with their qualifications. Likewise, most universities offer a program which named Master of Business Administration for this reason as well as the amount of novices have increasing who tends to choose this faculty. For instance, the study which has taken in Germany shows that this program peaked hit  education rates for last 5 years.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the number of individuals insist on the idea that anyone can accomplish in personal marketing career without higher education. They claim that tuition has affect in specific career areas, such as education, health. but not marketing.  Furthermore, with support of technology, being successful in business career is easier than previous years. To exemplify, two decades ago, people could make an advertisement solely on TV or radio to gain profit from their business, in contrast now social media gives them a great chance to flourish on their personal area.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I believe that the role of education is undeniable in any field from engineering to sculpturing. It provides coaching which all professionals need to fall depth of occupation. To personify, I initially was working as a teacher, as well as I had small business on jewellery. However, I didn't have income which I wish. Therefore, I decided to study in The Master of Business Administration and subsequently, I learned many secrets to become lucky businesswoman.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, related with our modern era, it is not tough to tackle with rising of amount in the private marketing. Otherwise, universities, training programs and practicing could have more out-turn to be professional businessman."}

I strongly disagree with this concept. This essay will explain the differences along with my perspective in upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, people who agreed with the statement believe that illegal acts should not be ignored. It can only hike the crime rate. Generally, young children mostly follow other people, they are unaware of the consequences of their actions. For instance, a mother and her one-year-old child were smashed on the road by a group of 16 years old boys due to unbalanced the vehicle because of high speeding. The boy who drove that vehicle was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Therefore, guilt should be punished, so it will not spread. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some citizens disagree with the statement, young children are the youth of the country. Harsh punishments will destroy their innocence. It will not only destroy their Present but also the future. Everyone needs one chance to prove themselves. Most of the mistakes are not planned, they just happened coincidently. For example, as per a survey, 90 % of doctors believe that the human soul is innocent, until, it will be threatened for reasons. It depends on every personality what they want to become. They will be harsher by getting harsh treatment. Thus, at least one change to the youth of the county so they can improve themselves.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, crime should not be avoidable but there should be differences between the punishment of the adults or the underage personalities."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "Few people think that juveniles should be punished the same as adults for doing serious crimes like robbery and mudders. I disagree with this statement because everyone deserves a second chance  and another reason is if they share the same bars with serious criminals then they become like them.\r\n\r\nFirst, youngsters do many crimes to become famous or some crimes for in their innocence therefore, they need second chance to take their life back on track because they have left their whole life in front of them so, they have time to change their life and also could serve for a country in future. For example,  many jails  allow their prisoners to learn some skill work and make the products and sell in the market which allow them to catch up with other people and also people accept them.\r\n\r\nSecond, some young people are not serious offenders if they are treated same like put in same jails as the other offender do then they cut off themselves from the world and push themselves towards  crime which will be dangerous for  society because they mix up with criminals and learn things from them and most importantly, they find new connections and links with other criminals which whitewash their brains and use them for their own purposes.for instance ,In recent survey, 70% of young children became big criminals who were rejected by society then they met with bad people and used by them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although punishment is important for any offender to make a fear in their mind, it is not a permanent solution  if people really want to change someone they should accept them and try to improve them on their mistakes rather than giving punishment."}

What could be the reasons for this? What solutions can you suggest?", "content": "In recent times, children have lower attention spans than in the past. This may be due to many reasons but I will be highlighting the main ones in this essay.\r\n\r\nWith the advance in technology, gadgets such as tablets and computers have become a common item in every household. Therefore, with the development of apps and games, most parents allow access to them as it gives parents a way to keep children busy. Moreover, these games are designed to give users quick bursts of dopamine which cause children, as well as adults, to be occupied for short game sessions. For example, flappy bird was a famous game which relied on users to tap the screen at the correct time which varied constantly but not exceeding more than a second. Consequently, harming their ability to concentrate for prolonged periods. \r\n\r\nThere are limited ways to solve this issue. One way would be for parents to set specific tasks to children within a certain time frame. For instance, clean their room in one hour. This would allow them to avoid procrastination and be focused on the task in hand. Admittedly, this would not be able to work every time but eventually they would develop discipline over time and be able to increase their attention span. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, being able to stay focused is a problem for many children in modern society. Schools and parents share this issue but do not appear to fully understand why. With the solutions proposed, there might be hope for future generations to have increased attention spans."}

While  some individuals believe that it's essential to focus on their main field books instead of wasting time  learning other trades too. In my ,view it is wise to have an overview of another discipline too.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, quite a number of students are interested in more open and versatile fashion by involving themself in a high range of subjects. Firstly, it's very important to have an understanding of different subjects in this contemporary world for better opportunities. To be precise, Few students have a plan for further study with different syllabi and it's always beneficial for them to devote some time to get a basic understanding in advance. For example, many engineers study engineering books and side by side also take a glimpse of management courses for their future. Moreover, this phenomenon is useful in office culture too, as project management gives more preference to  versatile people to take care of numerous responsibilities. Hence, having a knowledge of multiple areas very essential for the young generation to grow in their future study and carrier.\r\n\r\non the other hand, Some people  emphasise focusing on specific subjects instead of jacking on all trades. In this technology world study curriculum is already too much overloaded and covering all tasks and projects within a given timeline really requires lots of time and dedication. To elaborate, students who enrolled for medical and science schemes have super large syllabi and huge competition. It is essential to pay attention to respected relevant subjects to achieve better rank for better placement or Jobs. Apart from that, few professionals advised you to focus on a specific path to become the master, so you can perform best in that. \r\n\r\nTo Conclude, Although, a significant number of students adopt  the culture of reading many trades to get versatile knowledge.

From my perspective, it has more benefits than drawbacks, and both would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, the young generation wants to become freelancers as they feel this would provide a plethora of advantages. To begin with, they could do their job as per their own conditions and could provide job opportunities to others. In other words, they do not like to be bound  to employment from nine to seven, in fact, do not even like to follow the guidelines and rules of the workplace. Besides, they could earn much more profit in this manner, they need not  do hard work for others. For instance, while a person is being employed in an organisation, he would receive only hourly wage, no matter, if he had worked extra. Therefore, inhabitants, who do not like to share their earnings, or are restricted by regulations want to invest in their business merely.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, self-employed individuals need to face some challenges as well. Initially, they need to devote extra hours, especially at the earliest stages, whilst the earnings are quite low. Subsequently, some refuse to pursue it further, as they develop a fear of the risk involved in it. For example, business tycoons frequently talk about stress  and failures of their initiatives, they had to face obstacles, disappointments and loses they had to due to a few errors. Apart from this, they cannot enjoy the benefits that organizations provide to their employees, including health insurance, paid vacations, bonuses and certainly more. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, apparently, starting a new job costs huge sacrifices and dedication, however, once it would become a successful empire it could provide comfort and relaxation along with money.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "Different academic abilities exist among students, according to discipline, intelligence, and hard work. Some schools believe students should be grouped into different levels, depending on academic performance, while others disagree. In my view, this should never happen, as it induces numerous issues in both classes. The following paragraphs will explore both sides of the argument and highlight why I support one side.\r\n\r\nIndeed, overachievers feel underwhelmed when faced with the workload average pupils receive. It simply does not satisfy them to know they have locked potential, all due to their fellow classmates\u2019 inability to match their own standards. Above average students tend to feel more hungry for knowledge, looking for an actual challenge, which is somewhat understandable. By dividing a class into two, that could be achieved. Instant fiery competitiveness is induced between the overachieving classmates. Likewise, longer hours of teaching the academically average group makes a lot of sense, to ensure they understood the topic and to address any questions they may have. In addition to that, the A+ group can be introduced to advanced level topics, in order to fully unleash their potential, and satisfy their hunger for knowledge.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, new problems show up once a class of supposedly the same grade, is split up into two categories. This, essentially, implies to the classmates that there is a superior group and a dumb one. Consequently, members of the \u201cdumb class\u201d will feel inadequate, and immediately lose self-esteem and thus, their motivation. On top of that, the upper division will most likely adopt a superiority complex that leads to looking down upon their peers. A larger workload of homework is bound to inspire a feeling of unfairness among the lower level, as well as applying pressure on the higher level to naturally acquire that knowledge without the same amount of homework. To make the situation further complicated, not every school can afford paying double the salary for each grade.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, natural excellence is a blessing and a curse in disguise. While the academically blessed may score large numbers in tests, they feel bored being in the same classroom as less fortunate peers. Dividing the two solves that, while causing even greater problems, such as insecurity or lack of motivation. My opinion, ultimately, is that splitting colleagues of the same grade into two is harmful more than is helpful."}

Not only do they entertain children but also introduce them to the basics of  life such as kindness, tolerance and love. \r\n\r\nAnother advantage for kids watching TV is that they can obtain patience. The ability to sit still is very useful since it can come in handy at school, college or even work. What is more, when youngsters watch movies or animated movies, they learn to focus all their attention on the screen which can help them to develop concentration.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to  scientific ,research it is proven that watching television is harmful to the eyes. Consequently, spending a lot of time in front of a TV screen can lead to visual impairment, which is a common problem among young people. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, television can be addictive ,especially for little boys and girls. A lot of parents use cartoons as a way to calm their youngsters, which can result in a child's obsession with TV. In this case, a youngster becomes more interested in the imaginary world, shown in films and animated movies than in reality. Finally, a child can find it hard to socialize in the community.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, watching TV can be both advantageous and disadvantageous for kids, as they can learn something new but it can result in worsening of their eyesight. Following this, the pros overweight the cons since parents can control the amount of time their infants spend in front of the screen in order to prevent negative effects."}

Only small number of people go to their usual doctors,though, I do believe there is nothing negative in seeking unconventional methods of treating if people want so\r\n\r\nToday medicine is improving from day to day, doctors and proffesors try to find quicker and easier way of treating various diseases. Therefore people want to cure their health problems via these modern methods. It is completely normal as sometimes usual doctors cannot help and people need to find another way to solve health problems. There are a lot of examples when untraditional treatment helps people to win disease. For instance, Medical Center in Uzbekistan, which is famous in Central Asia by treating diseases, which doctors could not treat. In 2017, doctors from this medical Centre helped a boy who could not speak by their own special methods. So, sometimes alternative, and strange way treatment can be very useful. \r\n\r\nMoreover, in some cases, usual doctors do not have sufficient knowledge about a particular health problem. For example, in Kazakhstan quality of high education is extremely law, even in medical schools. Majority of people are aware about that and therefore give their preference to alternative medicines. However, this development might be incentive for usual medics to be more competent in order to get people's trust. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people may decide for themselves whether to try alternative treatments or to be content with local doctors. Personally , I feel that it is better to find medicine that will suit them and help them, even if it is unconventional treatment."}

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "The education system plays a pivotal role in shaping young minds, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in the world beyond school. Among the many components of education, regular examinations have been a subject of debate in recent years. This essay aims to delve into the significance of regular exams for teenagers in secondary school, focusing on how they contribute to preparing students for life after graduation. While some may argue against regular examinations, there is compelling evidence to suggest that they are indeed valuable in fostering critical thinking, time management skills, and developing a sense of accountability.\r\n\r\nOne of the key benefits of regular examinations is their ability to foster critical thinking skills among teenagers. Exams require students to think analytically, synthesize information, and apply their understanding to various scenarios. These cognitive processes are essential in preparing them for real-life situations where critical thinking is required, such as problem-solving in the workplace or making informed decisions. Moreover, regular exams encourage students to challenge their own assumptions and develop a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying.\r\n\r\nAnother argument in favour of regular examinations at the secondary school level is their ability to instil a sense of accountability in teenagers. Exams provide students with a tangible measure of their progress and performance, as well as a benchmark against which they can evaluate their achievements. This accountability not only motivates them to put in their best effort but also prepares them for the feedback and evaluation systems they may encounter in higher education or the workplace. Furthermore, the sense of accountability cultivated through regular examinations encourages students to take ownership of their learning and sets the stage for a proactive approach to personal growth.\r\n\r\nRegular examinations are undeniably valuable in preparing teenagers for the challenges they will face after leaving secondary school. By fostering critical thinking skills, cultivating time management, and instilling a sense of accountability, these exams contribute to the holistic development of students. Even though some may argue against the stress and pressure that exams may bring, it is crucial to recognize that real-life situations often demand individuals to perform under pressure. By implementing regular exams, secondary schools can equip students with the skills necessary to navigate these challenges, empowering them to reach their full potential and succeed in their future endeavours."}

At the same time, others believe that it will not display a proper result, and there are still other possible options. From my point of view, I strongly agree that there are several alternative methods available that can show an individual\u2019s talent.\r\n\r\nIt is widely acceptable that a paper test is a good choice to choose and score your knowledge rank. However, it is not the best way to do it because some are straightforward and can be memorised. When the problem has been adapted to fit into real situations, people cannot solve it since it is not similar to what they are trying to remember. For example, it has been seen quite often that top rank students who usually receive high marks in paper format fail to pass their lab or physical test whenever possible.\r\n\r\nMoreover, knowledge level can be measured by understanding how people explain or demonstrate extremely complex things understandably. The reason is that when individuals could not catch up on your points, they will keep asking, and your job is to clarify all their puzzles so you can proudly say that you truly master that topic. For instance, some high schools have admitted that it was sometimes also challenging for them to rap up every bullet point for their kids and ensure that it was simple enough for them to digest.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while paper exams are one of the good options traditionally used to assess knowledge accomplishment, other methods such as explanation or demonstration can be much more suitable because people always need to deal with unpredictable circumstances. Therefore, I believe other options besides paper-based are more reliable."}

Due to the increase in demand, some individuals believe that this form of travel should be limited due to the environmental pollution and the fact that it is diminishing the world\u2019s resources. I firmly believe that the industry should continue to grow to meet demand.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that as the global market for air travel grows so will the pollution. Therefore, the air we breathe will be less pure and the noise produced would harm our ears over time. Moreover, the large amounts of fuel being used on the aircraft that could potentially be used elsewhere. However, individuals would still need to travel to other countries. Consequently, the fuel and pollution produced by these inconvenient journeys would far exceed the resources used by a traditional airplane.\r\n\r\nTravelling by air is the safest form of travel. Therefore, having less flights would increase the number of vehicle collisions, leading to more deaths which would be a disadvantage to any society. For example, a family travelling eight hours by car as opposed to two hours by air are at a much higher risk of being in an accident. Not to mention the rise in traffic congestion which would lead to each trip taking longer, in turn causing more pollution and wasting more fuel.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, air travel is becoming more efficient as time goes on. The travel alternatives to these trips, especially long-haul flights are just not viable on a regular basis. In my opinion, air travel needs to be expanded not restricted."}

This essay displays a personal point of view  regarding  salary payment. Moreover, this support provides reasons why the motion is reasonable for those who read.\r\n\r\nFirst thing first, I personally agree people who opt to work in trust-worthy positions should be paid more rather those at the bottom. Furthermore, those who work in higher positions take a huge responsibility on a work basis. Thus, paying them more tends to be the right choice for the company where they work in. Continuously, people who work as CEO and higher have the most overwhelming schedule meaning that they are doing a valuable action for the company. For instance, the CEO needs to handle each division of the company to ensure the company runs as it supposes to. Consequently, those hard work should be paid in lots of budgets.\r\n\r\nIn reverse, individuals who have occupations on average to lower basis have less responsibility to do than those who are in upper positions. Paying them with a huge amount of money would be a waste. In addition, a wide range of salaries for the bottom position will harm the company's finance. However, sparing this source of finance should be done wisely.\r\n\r\nFinally, I am confident  support that society which takes roles in important positions should be given the rights of society with huge  budgets. On the other hand, those  in less crucial positions are not obligated to be paid more."}

This is directly linked to increased stress. The following paragraphs will analyze this problem and the appropriate solutions that may treat it.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, stress has many possible factors that contribute to it, not necessarily the extra work. However, employers must take action to ensure that the employees are not suffering, as this could lead to their self induced departure from a vital company job. A likely factor could be work overload, together with a demanding boss unwilling to listen to the complaints of the stationed below him in the work hierarchy. On top of that, the feeling of being unable to please your boss no matter what you do is demotivating. To make the situation even more complicated, a lack of breaks certainly worsens matters. It is also possible that the thought of family being away for too long is troublesome to most. Moreover, this eventually leads to homesickness. Last but not least, a noisy environment can never help an already exhausted individual.\r\n\r\nConsequently, employers must find ways to help keep a workplace ambient, as well as with high spirit. Almost all issues can be tackled, and this is no exception. To begin with, more frequent gaps between work are bound to refresh the minds of workers. Likewise, the commanding figure should be understanding and mindful of the load everyone is burdened with. Creating relationships with each individual member of the office will lower their anxiety levels significantly. Nonetheless, a member with authority should be firm and serious to keep the workplace running. Motivating the community to go beyond normal office hours is possible, once they are offered rewards for their efforts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, numerous cause stress exist, including diet, fitness, and other factors unrelated to jobs. Nevertheless, it certainly could be a job that is troubling an individual, whether it is the noisy nature of the area, terrifying leader, or being separated from family. Fortunately, they could be solved by creating a more peaceful atmosphere, with realistic expectations from each member."}

This essay will highlight what are the major reasons for obesity as well as the effects of the same on juveniles in the coming years.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, children are becoming obese due to two main reasons. Firstly, children are having an excessive intake of junk food. They usually prefer to eat burgers, pastries and pasta instead of having healthy homemade food. Like, families can be seen going to restaurants on the weekends, where they eat lots of calories leading to weight gain. Secondly, having a sedentary lifestyle is causing weight gain in children. To explain , children prefer to play indoor games these days, which don't involve physical activity leading to obesity. For instance, a survey conducted in the USA (United States of America) revealed that 80 per cent of children choose to remain at home watching television and doing indoor activities which are making them obese. Thus, a lazy lifestyle and junk food are making juveniles obese.\r\n\r\nWeight gain among children can lead to severe health issues in the future. People at a very young age will be suffering from heart disease. Due  to high levels of cholesterol in the blood vessels, juveniles will face heart failure. Furthermore, diabetes will become very common among juveniles in the coming time. To explain , due to obesity, juveniles will be having high levels of insulin in their body which will cause diabetes to them. For example, research in the northern part of India has shown that 60 per cent of obese people are suffering from diabetes and heart diseases. Therefore it can be said that obesity can lead to dangerous diseases.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this essay highlighted the causes of obesity among children are  junk food and a sedentary lifestyle. It also discussed how obesity can lead to  numerous effects on the health of children like it can cause diabetes and heart diseases to them in the coming future."}

To illustrate, the companies force their employees to work for long hours in order to increase the producitivity among their employees. This is because the job market in these days become more competitive and every company compete to provide a better services for their expect customers. Availability  of technology is another reason why people work for long hours in these days. The due to the fact that employers can contact with their workers via technology namely, computer, smartphone , which this can put a lot of pressure in workers. For example, some employers contact via technology with their workers during late time or their family time. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some measures can taken by the employers to mitigate this issue. The first effective solution, the employers could introduce policy  in order to  minimize  work hours. For instance, in Saudi Arabia the maximum working hours for all employees is 48 hours.  The employers  should not contact with their employees out of official time of work, which this can help employees to stay away for their jobs.

Although some people disagree with this idea, I totally think this should be the first priority of science.\r\n\r\nThe first reason why improving humans'lives is too prominent is that it will lead to a higher level of wellbeing. When people have a better quality of life, they are most likely to live happier and hopeful. For example, during pandemic the majority of scientists were trying to make a vaccine to eradicate the Corona virus and they eventually made a success. As a result, people now are capable of spending their time outside with ease.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, by emphasizing on improving people's quality of life as the most important aim of science, prevention can be the most significant result. In other words, when scientists are aware of their role in order to make citizens' lives better,they teach people how they can improve their physical and mental health. Thus, the level of illnesses as well as the cost of treatment would be reduced.\r\n\r\nSome argue that the most important responsible of science should be saving the environment. They refer to glabal warming phenomenon and it's catastrophic consequences in the future of humanity. However, I believe the performance of humans itself is the first reason why the globe is going to be warmer so through enhancing individuals' knowledge, many environmental issues would be declined.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think the ultimate goal of science should be making mankind's lives better as it brings wellbeing and prevention of many mental and physical diseases."}

This essay totally disagrees with that statement, I believe that it's not an obligation for hobbies to be difficult .......to be fun.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, when picking a leisure activity, individuals tend to choose something enjoyable, a pastime activity that helps them relax and decompress from a whole week of pressure and work; therefore, the level of difficulty is the last aspect that they base their choice on. Moreover, it has been proven in many studies and documentaries that most people enjoy the kind of hobbies that are simple and take an important amount of time to accomplish; hence, they get to spend most of their free time doing that, for instance, finishing missions of a video game or drawing a painting of a beautiful lake. \r\n\r\nSecondly, humans have a tendency to practice and enjoy collective activities in which every single one of them has a specific task to accomplish so the whole team wins; thus, it would be illogical for this particular game to be difficult. Furthermore, a lot of adults don't prefer hard activities for the simple reason that it requires them to use their muscles or their brain and to think hard to solve complex equations and missions because it makes them feel like they're at work. As a result, they tend to pick simple pastime activities.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, for the reasons mentioned above, my point of view is that hobbies don't have to be sophisticated to be enjoyable."}

I totally agree with this statement because driverless cars can have a positive impacts on both individuals and society.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several reasons why I believe that cars powered by artificial  intelligence can be beneficial for people and community. Regarding individuals, self-driving cars can create more time for people. This is because people could use commuting time from home to work or school in valuable things namely, sleep, relax, and finsh their work or study responsibilities. Therefore, make people live more comfortable. Furthermore, the vehicles powered by artificial  intelligence require less maintenance .This is due to the fact that self-driving vehicles often made from high quality materials compared to traditional cars. Consequently, people can avoid high cost of maintenance and they can save a considerable amount of money. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to society, the driverless cars can contribute alleviate traffic congestion. To illustrate, the traffic jams often result of bad drivers habits such as, sudden stop, sudden  turn right or  left , which means driverless cars can eliminate this bad habits of humans. Moreover, the driverless vehicles will assist to reduce the amont of Co2 footprint from cars. This is because cars powered by artificial  intelligence can use the fuel in efficient way. As a result, self-driving vehicles will contribute to mitigate climate change and global warming reuslt of minimize the amount of Co2 emissions on the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I strongly believe that self-driving cars can have a positive impacts on both people and community, because it will make the life of individuals more convenient and eonomical.

Some individuals believe this is completely in the governments hands, while others blame the parents. My view is that every parent is fully responsible for their child, whether it be their health, manners, or personality. The following paragraphs will explore both sides of the argument and why I disagree with immediately pointing fingers at the government in this case.\r\n\r\nAlthough it all comes down to the parents of the child at the end, governments possess the authority to get rid of the child obesity issue. A great first step could be reducing the insurmountable prices of healthy foods. Subsequently, parents with less financial stability would be able to afford nutritious food for their children. Likewise, schools encouraging young pupils to adopt a healthy lifestyle would help immensely. The FDA laws that companies abide by should grow stricter, thus forcing companies to sell nothing but nutritious products.\r\n\r\nConversely, I insist that parents have the ultimate influence on their family. After all, an apple never falls far from the tree. Almost everything regarding a child\u2019s mental or physical health is inextricably linked to the birth giver. All children should be encouraged to take up sports, no matter what the sport is. In addition to that, meals prepared for them must include all that is required by their growing bodies, all the while being delicious and appetizing. Fast food will always exist, as it will forever be consumed. Nonetheless, a young one can be taught not to consume fast food regularly due to the harm it causes his/her health.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the government has a responsibility to create the best possible environment for a family to have good nutrition. This is achievable by many methods, mainly making it possible for all people to afford the ingredients in a balanced diet. However, I believe the parents will always have the greatest authority, as they are closest to their young ones."}

It has been a major challenge to countries' governments to accomodate for\r\n\r\nthe highest ever number of people living in cities inspite of the improvements done in public services sectures, such as building new schools , hospitals and residential areas.\r\n\r\n Moreover, the increasing number of cars would really paly a role in worsening the pollution in cities. For instance, in Cairo, a study was done a study was done to show the \r\n\r\neffect of the immigration of 3 million households from\r\n\r\nrural areas to Cairo. Shockingly, this study revealed that there was a significant rise in pollution levels 3 months after the studied movement happened. \r\n\r\nSimilar studies have been done around the world and have all highlighted the possible consequences of the newley noticed trend. \r\n\r\nI believe that people moving to urban areas from the coutryside have a negative effect on the former too. Firstly, people who live in rural areas usually work in farms growing crops and\r\n\r\nbreeding many animals which provide  such as cows and chickens. Loss of such a vital sector of the work force will create shortages of important food items and the countries' government \r\n\r\nwould have to import these produces\r\n\r\nto fill the gap between production and consumption, a step that will negatively impact their economies. Secondly, city life is hectic and very busy while village life is more peaceful and calm, therefore, people moving to cities will notice a major\r\n\r\nchange in their lifestyle. Unfortunately, this change is not for the bettter, as it usually accomanied by increased level of stress and anxiety among those who have moved.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, i believe that people immigrating to cities have many drawbacks and an action need to be planned to decrease to ultimitly decrease and control this trend."}

Though it can be partially attributed to the hormonal imbalance that is specific for this age, it is mainly because of the increased inclination of the media towards aggression and violence. I highly agree with the opinion that the media is responsible for this current issue. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, after the 9/11 incident, people were really into watching the news related to terrorism. So, the producers used that notion and start making movies and games that were based on this strategy. With such an influx of the same kind of programmes every now and then, adolescents usually adapt to them more easily. For instance, a recent study in China shows that there is a 20% increase in  juvenile detention in the last 10 years and the major reason for it is  their increased involvement in unlawful activities.  So, the government should impose a ban on telecasting of such dramas and movies and should impose a high charge for creating them.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, kids are usually very interested in playing video games and there are a lot of games based on the war and killings of people. These games should be banned as soon as possible by all means. There should be immediate action against them by the authorities. Parents should keep a close eye on their children and should activate the automated filters, both on TV and gadgets for the safety purpose.  Along with that, teenagers should be provided with enough opportunities to relax and enjoy themselves so that they start focusing on more positive things. The government should open more parks and should make arrangements for local sports competitions. Meanwhile, parents should enrol them on gyms, swimming classes and computer programming courses. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, utilising their energy in positive perspectives will help them to become better and responsible citizens in the future. Teaching them about the hazards is important but providing them with better alternatives is equally important."}

Although many economists laud this, environmentalists hold a diverse perspective. However, I am of the stance that owning motorcars has a malignant effect on the environment, state involvement can be the panacea for this. In the following lines, the previously-mentioned points will be thoroughly elaborated.\r\n\r\nTo embark on, recent technological development has led to the reduction of costs and the increase in productivity. In other words, when international organisations utilise their financial capabilities to purchase fully automated production lines, they boost their rate of production and decrease their expenditures. For example, Toyota, a renowned Japanese brand, is well-known for its exploitation of its expertise to produce cars with satisfactory quality and a relatively lower price. Hence, what can be deduced is that new technology is the chief rationale behind producing cars at an industrial scale and making them affordable to the populace.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are a number of remedies for this. If governments launch awareness campaigns to highlight the dangers of exhaust fumes and introduce profound communal transportation networks, the public will place their reliance on trains and buses because they are environmentally-friendly. For instance, despite the high-income of German citizens, many of them prefer using public transportation systems to taking their private vehicles to less air pollution. Thus, what can be inferred is that legislators should alter the behaviour of their citizenry by introducing other alternatives.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the aforementioned points, it can be reiterated that the abundance of vehicles at a lower price is the predominant factor that encourages ordinary individuals to own cars. In my view, the interference of politicians is of utmost importance to mitigate the impact of this malicious trend."}

I agree with this notion and am going to discuss both aspects.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a strong economy means rich and wealthy nations. In addition, the population is affluent and even lower-income communities have modest incomes and resources. The government has the services and assets to aid citizens in every possible way. For example, the public has reasonable job opportunities and salary rates,  health-related assistance and other forms of help and services.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are other factors a democracy needs in order to be rich, strong and powerful. Free education leads to an increase in literacy rate and there will be  more research, discoveries, and inventions in every realm of life. Moreover, there will be awareness among the masses about environmental issues and other social and global matters. Nowadays, our world has turned into a small global village where anyone can find an enormous amount of knowledge and information. A well-educated individual knows which online information is correct and needs to follow  and which needs to ignore. Education brings this awareness and sense of perception. Thus, an increase in literacy levels will automatically raise the growth of any state. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, undoubtedly, economic and other kinds of developments play an important role in any agrarian\u2019s growth and development.

This situation is like a coin with both aspects of pros and cons, but this essay will state the advantages of this drastic shift over-rides the disadvantages. \r\n\r\nTo commence, I would spare some light on the benefits of choosing work-based training. Firstly, nowadays employers are looking for some with a few years of industrial experience even for the entry-level position available in the corporate sector. Followed by the unchanged teaching methodology of the graduate curriculum making it more difficult for new graduates to secure a job and kick-start their career. While industrial training program is much more inclined towards the job role and its responsibility, hence allowing the minors to support their families after the completion of the program. Lastly, getting an education from a reputed college required a hefty amount of funds and most time this money is borrowed by the banks creating a stressful environment for the youth. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are even a few disadvantages to opting for these corporate programs. To initiate, the student enrolled in the program is stuck with only one career option taking away the thrill of learning something and exploring their potential. For instance, a study revealed that people who are enrolled in this industrial education often lack a wide range of knowledge reducing their chance of growing in future. But has even proven that these individuals are masters of their working stream making them unbeatable.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, the corporate sector training program can outweigh the university education if the teaching pattern is not upgraded and students are offered hybrid courses, that are a mix of industrial experience and a variety of subjects to choose from."}

I believe that the government should definitely support retired workers, especially the ones who have had a larger impact on the country\u2019s well-being.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that most people have a rough idea on when they would like to retire so planning in advance and having the ability to save money for their future is a big reason why the government shouldn\u2019t pay. Therefore, it would make sense for the government to refuse financial support in this case. However, many jobs on minimum wage, especially the one\u2019s directly involved with the government, do not make enough money to save for retirement. As a result, they would need extra support financially.\r\n\r\nNow to why the government should pay, there are multiple reasons. One of them being that many individuals pay taxes and have jobs that they can only sustain during their younger years. For example, soldiers working in the army retire younger and find themselves jobless after retirement. Not to mention how much they sacrifice for their country, only to be left with nothing as soon as they finish their service. As far as taxes are concerned, most of the money that the public spend, many of them never see the impact it has on the country. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the government should aim to implement schemes that give back to some of the most valuable members of our society. Without them, the country would struggle to function effectively. To give them nothing in return is a disgrace to the government."}

Additionally, living in a hotel as a tourist won't lead to circumstances in which a human learns about the country.

These range from budgeting to travel, to pension costs and sudden accidents. For example, we have a car accident on the way to the office that needs cash to recover both the car and ourselves. If we don't have wealth in our bank account, it is too hard to solve this problem because we need to go to the bank and submit for a loan that there is a possibility of not being approved.

There are many types of investment that are offered today by banks or securities from low to high returns. \r\n\r\nIn comparison, many societies think that we only live once and there is no guarantee that we still live tomorrow. For this reason, spending all of our wealth is the best way to enjoy this life because we can have whatever we want and try anything before we die.

On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both sides and give your opinion.", "content": "It is considered by some that being a university graduate is the key to securing a good job, while there are others who think that it is better to have experience and soft skills. In my opinion, I believe that having a university education is essential for academic jobs, while soft skills and experience are more useful in business.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many think it is easier for most people to find a good job if they are university graduates with a good degree. In other words, having tertiary education puts people one step ahead of others who do not and this can be the deciding factor in getting a good job. The competition to get into universities and the increasing number of graduates show just how significant this level of education is for people's future work opportunities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, having work experience and soft skills, such as leadership skills and other interpersonal skills, can also throw the balance in favour of the applicant, according to some. For many positions there are an overwhelming number of applicants and, therefore, it is often thought that having relevant experience in that line of work or having acquired useful soft skills that can be valuable to a company, can put one ahead of the game when applying for a position.\r\n\r\nFinally, in my opinion, whether needing a high level of education or skills and experience, depends on the position being applied for. Take for example law, medicine or teaching, it is impossible to be considered for a position without the required educational background. In contrast, in business, it would be more important for a candidate to have soft skills and experience in that line of business so they can step into a position without further training and be of immediate benefit to the company.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, getting a good job requires a relevant background either in experience or education depending on the type of work and field. People should make sure they attain the necessary skills or degrees before applying for a job in order to be sure of success."}

Each person may experience various kinds of difficulties in their life, and this leads to different responses. In this essay, I will elaborate on the extent to which I disagree or agree that people should accept the bad situation as it is and provide reasons for such arguments. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, some people believe accepting the faith or the result of unsatisfactory situations, such as an unsatisfying work environment or lack of money, helps them to overcome the situations. It has been believed that unfortunate events may teach them some lessons, for example, patience, and motivate them to be better and try different things with the prospect of different results. These kinds of people are not the kind of people who give up easily. Instead, they understand the mistake they made, found solutions, and project them to other opportunities. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, some people tend to not easily accept the situations and try to escalate the effort to maximize the circumstances and get the best outcomes. For example, Thomas Alfa Edison ultimately managed to invent the light bulb after more than 1000 times trying. If he had given up just after one or two first attempts, the world we live in today would not exist. From the example, we can learn that being persistent and resilient to be better at overcoming bad situations may lead us to greater success.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, each response has its own benefits.

A number of parents buy their children many toys to discover. In this essay, I will tackle the different pros and cons of this matter. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a lot of material things  that are beneficial in a kid's journey. Musical instruments, rattles, stuffed toys, and bicycles are just some of the toys that can be found in the mall which are very attractive to the youngsters. As a mother, I am guilty of buying almost anything I think my son needs and also those he's been wanting to have. Because of that, I can observe that he has developed different skills such as learning how to ride the bike, or how he finds music interesting, and even playing pretend using dolls. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, because he has a lot of toys to choose from, some toys are being neglected. A child can only focus on what he finds enjoyable at the moment and forgets to play with the others. As a result, it will just be placed in the stock room and sometimes be forgotten. As an example, my husband and I bought our offspring a  basketball ring because he was so  into basketball at that time, but eventually got tired of it and puzzles that shifted his attention. \r\n\r\nTo end, whilst toys are essential things needed for a child's development, the number should also be kept to a minimum.

This means that, they \r\n\r\nget plenty of time to involve themselves  in different  activities in which they are interested , and  return to their studies with renewed energy and focus. Secondly, a age gap  enhances the personal growth of the admission. For instance, student's participation in numerous field help build confidence to cope with uncertainties, make them experienced in various activities, and their mistakes and eventually prepares them for  higher studies.\r\n\r\nHowever, a year break has also some  major disadvantages such as the increased risk of involvement in illegal activities and chances of becoming demotivated.When recruitment does not find appropriate works they  may  involve in selling drugs, trafficking, committing crimes and so on .For example, not all students are  blessed with a strong financial background and can afford travel expenses, internships, or other opportunities, which can lead them to engage in criminal action.What\u2019s more, long holidays can make pupils  lazy and  tired.For instance, they lack a sense of maturity and are unable to obtain applicable jobs, face breakups with their partners, family pressure and other hindrances that hinders personal growth.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  a year off has certain negative effects like the potential for unlawful actions and losing enthusiasm. In spite of that, it has an extremely positive influence on learners' educational achievement and self-actualization."}

To what extent do you agree or not agree?", "content": "In recent years, it has been a controversial and debatable topic if luck can be the only factor leading to success.From my perspective, achieving goals and dreams requires determent and hardworking, and it is not about good fortune.  In the following paragraphs, I will express my opinion and support it with valid reasons and examples, and reach a reasonable conclusion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, converting a dream into reality may require many things. One main point is determent and passion. This involves the welling of trying over and over until the aim is secured. My culture has a famous kid's tale where an ant holding rice trying to reach its home over the hill. Whenever it reached almost the top, it trampled again and fell. This ant kept trying until it eventually and successfully reached the top of the hill.  This story can illustrate the importance of attempting and repeating the action until reaching the desired destination, as well as not being afraid of committing mistakes or failure. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, another key to success is planning. To clarify, people who arm their dreams and goals with methods and strategies are more able to achieve them as long as those goals are realistic. For instance, if a government would like to fight corruption, they need to enforce a law against it and apply strong penalties. Consequently, this will lead to hitting the goal, which is the increment in the level of honesty. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, people argue all the time that good fortune may or may not be behind their achievements. However, I strongly believe that hardworking, insisting, passion and planning are the most effective key factors that ease the way to greatness."}

This essay will discuss the main consequences of migrating to city areas  and propose some solutions of this problem.\r\n\r\nThe main consequences caused by farmers relocating in different city areas are a decrease in agricultural products and an  increased risk of over population.Farmers are the backbone of a country because they provide food to people.When individuals from agricultural backgrounds seek higher work prospects, they tend relocating to  places where they can meet their requirements.As a result, less production leads to a scarcity of food and hampers gross domestic product of a country. Additionally, dependency on other countries also increases. Moreover, as city areas are already crowded by large numbers of people, when farmers move to these places, it becomes overpopulated and unmanaged.For instance, in Kathmandu, a large proportion of people coming to settle every year  has deteriorated the quality of life in a city. Air pollution, noise pollution, and finding suitable jobs are the major rising challenge of downtown areas.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best solution to these results is building schools, colleges, and hospitals in the countryside. Firstly, most  parents want their children to be educated, healthier and  have a bright future. When colleges and hospitals are built in such areas, obviously, the number of people moving to city areas will eventually decrease. Moreover, farmers should be provided subsidies and other facilities. If loans are provided by government to farmers, then they can enhance their performance and productivity. Insecticides, pesticides, manures, irrigation facilities, and other essential materials should be granted  to boost the agricultural sector. Thus, fulfilling the needs of farmers leads to the overall well-being of a country.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the trend of people moving to  downtown areas in search of career openings results in many consequences, including scarcity  of crops and an unmanaged population. The most effective solution is to furnish  health, higher education and most importantly, subsidies to local people by the authorities."}

Secondly, it also leaves an impression on the economy. \r\n\r\nFor the first cluster of people, regular activities such as washing and drying  clothes may highly be suffered from the conditions with snow and heavy precipitation. Moreover, this could also create problems with the availability of food items. In addition,  individuals can also feel  difficulty in travelling from one place to another.  In addition,  traffic disturbance could also be noted as a result of the worst climatic situations. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the second school of thought is associated with the effect of a poor atmosphere on the economy of the country. Furthermore, the seasonal outcome of Gross Domestic Product is mapped to the availability of the livestock, the products for import and exports, and the travel business may slow down for a limited time period. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the major problem of climate change has seen a big impact on different avenues. Not only does it affects the living style but it could also be bad for the business and growth of the country.

Why is happiness difficult to define? How can people achieve happiness?", "content": "Whether money can buy happiness has been an ongoing debate for many years. Happiness is one of the most difficult emotions to define as there are multiple factors which determine one\u2019s contentment in life. I will be proposing a few ideas on how one can achieve happiness.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we have to define what is happiness? For some it may be family, for others it is having abundant wealth. Therefore, the meaning of happiness is incredibly difficult to determine. Moreover, in recent studies, multiple factors have been used to attempt to define happiness. These include, living conditions, wealth, family, etc. For example, a poorer person in Africa may not have wealth, but have family which gives them enough happiness. This is why some of these studies are not reliable but may be able to give some indication of how happiness can be measured.\r\n\r\nThere are some ways people can be happier. The main way would be to prioritise what makes them happy. As discussed above, this can vary from person to person. Moreover, a big reason people are not happy in modern society is that their focus is always on what they don\u2019t have as opposed to what they do have. Consequently, making them feel empty and dissatisfied with life. Therefore, being grateful is a key factor to achieve happiness and practicing being grateful can be quite simple. For example, every morning, people can write down three things they are grateful for before starting their day.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, happiness is very personal and may have a different meaning to each person. Being able to identify what makes a person happy and focusing on that would be the way to achieve happiness. There are no set parameters so everyone\u2019s journey is different."}

It is alleged that the majority of illness, such as a huge proportion of gastric perforation and enterogastritis, is generally attributed to the unhealthy or unreasonable diet of inhabitants. Hence, encouraging individuals to form a reasonable and balanced diet habit serves as an effective and efficient way to diminish the rate of illness. In this case, the pressure of an overloaded medical system can be released to a great degree, which means the government can distribute more funds to other domains.\r\n\r\n\u3000\u3000 On the other hand, it is unpractical, unresponsible and unrealistic to transfer the responsibility that residents should take to the government. Individuals ought to take the initiative to\u00a0attend to themselves. Unlike infants, most citizens are equipped with the ability to take care of themselves. It's nearly effortless for individuals to form a healthy diet spontaneously, while it is of great difficulty for the government to spur citizens into action.\u00a0For instance, even if the authority enforces a related status, it cannot be implemented without the cooperation of individuals.\r\n\r\n\u3000\u3000In my opinion, while the authority should get involved in the forming of a diet, individuals are expected to shoulder the main responsibility. The government, possessing a wide\u00a0range of functions, ought to invest the energy and capital into other fields such as military units and police force, rather than some domain that individuals should take over. Only by distributing duties scientifically and reasonably, can  society function well\u00a0and march on."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "It is claimed that modern society should re-embrace the time-honored, traditional values of family and community that it has abandoned. In my point of view, it is true that more importance  should indeed be attached to the household and collectivism, but it seems unrealistic to apply those old values in contemporary society.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, more appreciation toward our family and community would help to strengthen family bonding and promote social cohesion. Individualism has eroded the younger generation, making them indifferent to what happens in their own communities or even in their own homes. Once old-fashioned concepts come back, people can be unconsciously influenced and thereby spend more time accompanying their family members and giving an ear to their elderly parents. In the meantime, more participation and support from neighbours would be seen in all kinds of communal activities. This progress, viewed in the long run, will necessarily bring a united and harmonious nation.\r\n\r\nHowever, when trying to arouse people\u2019s awareness of respecting their family units or communities, the risk of hypercorrection should not be ignored. This is because, being well-educated and growing up in this enlightened society, people nowadays have stronger individual consciousness and refuse to have their lives arranged. Facing the huge generation gap, some people may have to sacrifice their personal choices and values and submit to the preference of their parents, if asked to \u201crespect\u201d the decision made by their family. Worse still, some minority groups, in order to be more socially accepted, are likely to weaken their identity and follow the modern social trend blindly, which will also pose a threat to our social diversity.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we are supposed to pay more attention to  traditional family values and the sense of community, but it does not mean that these old ideas should be fully accepted in this ever-evolving world."}

The commercial display has brought  massive success in convincing people to shop for items. On the other hand, because of its common use, some people argue that commercial broadcasts are no longer unique. However, I disagree that advertisements no longer attract people. In this following essay, I will elaborate on the extent to which I agree that advertisements still attract individuals to buy things and provide some examples. \r\n\r\nThe commercial publication has been used for many years in order to levitate the rate of sales, as it promotes and persuades people to buy items. There are many forms of advertisements, for example, billboards, flyers, or video motion on television or website. Marketing companies have their own unique ways to promote their sales, aiming their market target, and constructing their advertisement concept. Marketers use models, various colours and unique places to produce a certain characteristic of publicity. Because of this reason, I believe using advertisements as a way to boost sales is a creative idea. \r\n\r\nHowever, people may seem bored with two-dimensional space advertisements. Hence, these days, companies tend to use three-dimensional space commercial displays. This can be seen, for example, Maybelline a cosmetic companies, use fake lashes at the top of a bus and a train in London and complete with the brushes, to promote their mascara products. As a result, people are attracted to their promotion and the number of their mascara production increased. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, advertisements have an effective way to escalate the sale rate. However, advertisers have to be more creative in terms of conceptualizing and producing unique and appealing advertisements."}

In this following essay, I will discuss thoroughly the positive and negative impacts and provide some evidence of this behaviour towards children.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, promoting hard work can be advantageous for young people in some ways. Maximizing effort is essential to sharpening persistent and resilient skills. With these skills, children are able to adapt to difficult situations and find the solution to solve the issues that may occur. For instance, in order to achieve straight A\u2019s, students must prioritize and be willing to commit to homework, long-hour mentoring sessions, and practice with various kinds of tests with different levels of difficulty. However, hard work must be done with consistency. Hence, by combining these two attitudes, children will perform much better and leading to higher chances of success.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, hard work may bring an unpleasant impact on children. A long-haul discipline without any rest may cause burnout and disrupt the mental health condition. For example, if we force children to study without any rest or day off, success is not something that is close to achieving, instead they will get stressed which even leads to depression. To ease some pressures, it is important for children to have some personal traits, such as holidays or going out with friends. Furthermore, aside from taking some time off, setting goals and purposes may also help young people to map out their effort and know what to achieve. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, indeed hard work motivates children in achieving their goals and dreams. However, it is also important to note, a hard effort may bring pressure which leads to harmful impacts. Hence, setting clear goals and having some time off may balance the negative impact of hard work."}

Why do more people want to study at university? Is it positive or negative?", "content": "Tertiary education is a valuable resource in many societies and the escalating number of applicants is strengthening its blessed status. In this essay, I will analyze the main reasons for this phenomenon and follow this discussion with critical comments on its influence on both individuals and the whole society.\r\n\r\nFor present-day youngsters, a certificate of bachelor's degree is more than a qualification . Instead, it is a guarantee of a handsome salary,a promising career and even a higher social class. Colleges prepare graduates in job-seeking, with specialized skills and a diploma of a certain major, enabling them to be employed by prestigious enterprises. Besides the direct and visible benefits brought by university education, years of campus life are believed as a great opportunity to expand one's social circle and become insightful. Brains gather together and exchange their ideas, rendering every participant open-minded and future-oriented. Therefore, Universities, which are generally described as Ivory Tower, successfully attract millions of talents and are also the original place of countless groundbreaking ideas.\r\n\r\nRegarding the impact of the increasing popularity of attending university, I have to admit the benefits are evident while the risk of mindlessly pursuing a place given by those academic organizations should never be overlooked. As is aforementioned, studying in a college, especially those national-class or world-class one, facilitates access to the success of alumni. More importantly, a country will necessarily benefit from a growing number of well-educated youngsters ,with  corresponding higher productivity and lower crime rate. However, for those who are academically disadvantaged , this trend will inevitably put them in a catch-22 . It can be observed that some of them are forced to further their study but not to  pursue their real passion. Worse still, unemployment is another painful consequence brought by \"college fever\" .It can be noticed that in many countries, the graduation season coincides with the unemployment season during the gradually losing competitiveness of university students. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is understandable that applicants spare no effort to win a place in their dream school, yet the profound influence needs to be critically and carefully analyzed."}

Water is used almost in every field of the daily life activities such as cooking, cleaning, washing, and drinking. First cluster belongs the idea of sharing it in limited quantity. There are several benefits associated to this class. Giving it upto the desired level, avoid wasteage issues. When the water is assigned in a limited quantity, people are careful while using it. They will be bound to take a calculated amount out of their storage. On contrary, sometimes, they might not have enough water. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the second thinking says that the water should be provided without specifying the litres. They feel that it is very important to access water everytime. One should not face a problem due to water shortage. These individual overlook the fact that there are chances of losing a large quanity without even noticing. It is crucial and vital for this group to realise the importance of water and avoid unnecessary utilization. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, water has a lot of usage in daily life.

Do you think this is a positive or negative development?", "content": "Nowadays young generations are adoring media and sports stars, despite the fact that they do not display a good example. I believe this is a bad development because young people could follow the negative influence of some media and sports stars and it can affect their activities in school.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, media and sports stars tend to show inappropriate actions that can influence people to do the same thing as they did, especially since most of the people who were influenced by them are young people. In order to make their ratings high, some media broadcast hot gossip that could make people interested in it and most of them are related to underage content. For instance, TikTok display tiktokers that wore transparent clothes which are under age content and it reach 2 million viewers. As a result, kids will be curious and start to search for the same content which may lead to addiction to 18+ videos.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some kids imitate the inappropriate habits and behaviour of their favourite athletes, and they depict actions that lead to a bad attitude in their school activities. For instance, young people are smoking in their school area because they thought that it is an awesome action to be shown and it will affect their studies and activities because they have addicted to smoking. As a result, schools will give heavy sanctions and worse they will drop out of school.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, media and sports stars tend to give a bad influence on young generations. It will start with curiosity and end in the addiction to  underage content. Some young people may even imitate their bad actions such as smoking, and as a ,result the activities in school will be disturbed and worse school will drop out them."}

In my opinion, the merits of migrate of  people from their homwtown to other places outweigh the demerits because this development beneficial for personal and professional life of people. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the primary drawback of migrate people from the area where they were born and brought up  to other area is they can face culture shock .  This is because moving to a new zones means experience a new culture and custom, which means people  are moer vulnerable to  struggle in order to  adapt with this a new experience. Consequently,people will become under stress result of experience a new culture and maybe they get mental health issues namely, depression, anxiety.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would like to argue that the benefits of move people from the area where they were born and brought up significantly more than downsides. The first advantage, people will experience a new culture and custom, which means people will become more open mind to accept diversity cultural.  As a result, this development can contribute to spread the peace on the world  through unite people together.  A better job opportunity is another advantage for moving people away from their hometown to a new cities or town. For example, people who move from developing countries to industrialized countries are more likely to get a better jobs with good salaries, which means migration  improve the quality  of people live. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, In my perspective, although the moving people away from the area where they were born and brought up can bring downisdes namely, culture shock, I still believe the the upsides of this development outweigh the downsides, because is advantagous for personal as well as professional life of individuals."}

There can be different reasons why people prefer it but personally, I do believe that it is better for people.\r\n\r\nSupporters of this idea usually say that every person should have guaranteed roof over a head, a home, which will always welcome its master and will not requite any payments for it. They are convinced that it is extremely important to own a house by their middle ages, also. It is impossible to live in a renting house at the ages of 70-80, they believe. For example, people especially 40-50 aged ones, in Kazakhstan support this point of view because it is a convention in their culture. Centuries ago youngsters of Kazakh Khanate had had aim of constructing their own house, which is named as a \u201cYurt\u201d for their future families. And today this tradition is still exists, with houses, changed only\r\n\r\nAs a citizen of country where it is a convention to buy own houses, I agree that it is a positive development. Firstly , everyone has to think about his/her future. Renters might be evicted from house at any time, so they will not have a place to go. Therefore it is not really safe to rent accommodations. Furthermore, it is cheaper to live in house which owns to a person rather than pay monthly to someone who cannot even guarantee safety. Moreover, youngsters of these countries will be more independent if they will have a name to buy own house. They will be responsible for their house and everything that it requires, such as paying taxes, for instance. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, different countries may have different occasions, undiscussed question, like in Kazakhstan\u2019s example.

Also, according to recent statistics, 70% of book lovers use e-books and read via them. This shows that in the near future, it is possible that e-books will completely replace paper books. Moreover, as far newspapers and books are now becoming less popular among people, it will not be a profitable business to sell them. \r\n\r\nPeople give their preference to digital texts for different reasons. Firstly, they do not require any payments, and this aspect is very attractive to readers. Secondly, there is no need to go somewhere, to leave home and pay for vehicle. Therefore, it is again, more profitable for reader as she/he does not spend money to get to a particular shop.

Discuss both views and give Your opinion", "content": "Owing to the irreversible trend of globalization, people are motivated to learn foreign languages for overseas travel and study. Some argue that students should acquire a second language once they attend school whilst others contend that they should start during secondary school. It is obvious that learning a second language early in earlier childhood can enhance students\u2019 international competitiveness in both academic and career aspects. On the contrary, the amount of time can be invested in sensory motor development if young kids start learning foreign languages during secondary education, leading to better holistic development. From my perspective, I believe that the two ideations stand their ground, depending on the parenting styles. \r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, language abilities such as speaking and writing skills are inherently important assets for people who pursue international study and overseas employment. Take Hong Kong as an example, English is a core subject in the standard proper education system, which requires students to learn as early as in kindergartens. Most of the learners in Hong Kong need to go through intensive English training during their study journeys. As a result, the majority of Hong Kong students are capable of using Chinese and English upon graduation, leading to a solid bilingual background for them to strike for better chances in employment in multinational companies and to study abroad, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. (compared to neighbouring cities such as those Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan, HK students speak better English because they start it at an early stage\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, instead of a new language, parents can focus on the sensory-motor training, which is valuable for the early development in child\u2019s the infancy stage. For example, an increasing numbers of parents nowadays tend to provide training in swimming for toddlers because this sport can effectively build up their physical strength and coordination between body muscles, sensory systems and concentration ability. Apart from learning new languages, the development of these abilities can not be overlooked and the delay of language learning, when compared to a holistic development, can be deemed a reasonable action. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, both sides of this topic are supported by legitimate arguments about the advantages of their stands. Personally, I support that parents should let their children learn in the best interest of early childhood development, instead of blindly following either side.

What are the positive effects of this trend on personal and professional relationships? Could online forms of communication lead to superficial connections?", "content": "In our modern time, people relay information differently as a result of technological advancement. In my opinion, relationships have, for the most part, improved in two major ways through this phenomenon. I am also convinced the use of new means of communication, made available through the Internet, could potentially give rise to less meaningful interactions.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that, on a personal level, technology has enabled us to stay in touch more easily. People used to communicate through the postal system if they wished to contact someone who lived far from them. This system was cumbersome and often led to loss of connection. Through programs such as Skype or WhatsApp, everyone can now speak to their friends and relatives around the world whenever they please. In addition, whereas working professionals had limited opportunity to get to know their colleagues before, they can, at the present time, use various websites to find out about them. Website such as Instagram or LinkedIn have helped staff members to find common interests to talk about at work.\r\n\r\nI further believe that Internet-based platforms sway individuals into staying connected mainly in the virtual world. For example, there are people who have hundreds of friends on sites such as Facebook, yet they rarely speak to them about important issues in life. Another reason why relationship mat at times remain superficial could be attributed to impaired social skills. Since some people refrain from socializing in real-life situations and instead chat with others through the Internet, they fail to establish deep connections through face-to-face communication. The youth, in particular, might prefer to spend their time online and miss the chance to practice their skills to form intimate relationships.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, technological innovations have revolutionized both our personal and professional lives by allowing us to communicate with friends, relatives and colleagues less effortfully. We can also discover a lot more about others\u2019 interests through social media. From my  perspective, however, since more people prefer to spend their time online, missing the chance to develop their social skills, engaging in cutting-edge forms of communication could diminish the depth of their relationships."}

For instance, Shein is a familiar website for both gender clothes, that website provides the purchaser with high quality and speed delivery in 7 days . This is why an enormous number of people tend to purchase their products online. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSecondly, online shopping saves people's efforts. Moreover, it provides variety among the products.

Both of these choices have advantages and disadvantages in taste, price, time, and nutrition. This essay will discuss these views and give a conclusion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, buying ready-to-eat meals is better for both customers and owners. To begin with customers, they get more space to do other jobs because they don't spend an hour cooking. Furthermore, this option is a good choice for one who can not cook. People also can choose many kinds of bread that can be bought based on their nutrition, taste, countries, etc. Moreover, the cafe owner will hire many staff to cook and serve the cuisine in their cafe, so it will decrease the level of unemployment. For instance, students who graduate with a cooking major can find jobs easily because there is a lot of job vacancy in restaurants.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many eateries that falsify their foodstuff content. For example, there is a bakery that sells vegan bread, but in ,fact they cook it using non-vegan ingredients. We, as customers also hard to make sure that the cuisine process is as clean as the government's standards. There is a lot of case of poisoning and allergies caused by restaurant food. So, buying ready-prepared cuisine is not always the best choice for humans.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, buying meals in an eating place is a good choice if we have no hours to cook, but always make sure to buy from certified eateries to avoid disease. I strongly believe that the public can search on the internet or ask friends for recommended restaurants before buying a portion of a meal from there."}

For instance,  western culture and the middle east, these days merge together by downloading each music and listening deeply to it. So, music is a way to bring the community together by hearing it. \r\n\r\nThe second reason would be about the production of music and it tells people about the past and the origin of humans. Because  it shows people that humans are the same and they are living for one common goal.

The reasons behind this phenomenon will be discussed in the following essay along with the effects of it on both individual and social perspectives.\r\n\r\nThere are many factors that result in the popularity of shopping, and the major one is that this activity can provide a perfect social atmosphere for the general public. That is because during the process of shopping, it is natural for people to talk about the clothes they try, the decoration styles of shops, and price changes of the brands they love, thereby, people can never feel awkward because of losing topics when shopping. In addition, they can find their similar aesthetic preferences about clothes in this procedure, leading to a deeper understanding and a fostered connection with their friends. For example, Maci, the largest shopping centre in Boston, is full of shoppers who see shopping as their best way to relax and get along with close friends, according to  recent research by Harvard.\r\n\r\nThe increasing popularity of shopping can have effects on individuals and society as a whole. On an individual level, people can get sufficient exercise at the time of shopping, because people believe the comparison is the key factor to find their favourite clothes, and this requires a long distance walk in most cases, which could be undoubtfully beneficial to people who have to sit for an extended period of time in working days. On the other hand, this trend can also benefit the whole society because it can promote businesses. With more people willing to shop, entrepreneurs can sell their products at a quicker speed, leading to less storage and a larger amount of cash flow in their accounts. Therefore, they can afford to invest in the development of new products and machines, resulting in a prosperous economy in the entire country.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is an increasing number of people who take shopping as their favourite leisure activity because they can talk with friends and foster their connections in this progress, and this trend can be both advantageous to individuals by allowing for enough exercise and becoming healthier, and to the society as a whole by promoting the economy."}

In my opinion, this happens because of some reasons, and there are several actions that need to be taken to address this in order to mitigate such waste.\r\n\r\nA range of reasons why tons of cooking are being discarded. Firstly, some grub or drink lose their quality after a very short period of time when reserved. This is because such meals usually have genetically modified ingredients to improve their taste. These components are presented in some meals at fast food brands, for instance, which makes them impossible for refrigerating or warming up. Furthermore, another significant reason is the culture of a society. To illustrate, the vast majority of families in some countries order much more food as a kind of generosity and kindness. These people usually attend many events on a daily basis such as lunch invitations or dinners, and to show how they care about their friends and therefore, they request these high amounts of food. Consequently, immense amounts are thrown away.\r\n\r\nEffective solutions should be proposed to tackle the issue described above.First and foremost, to reduce the danger of this problem and food being wasted, governments should act more by implementing rules and regulations on shops by forcing them to reduce the harmful ingredients in these grubs. By putting a limit on such damaging ingredients, leftover food potentially lasts longer for use since there are no negative effects from chemicals. Another way to solve this problem is that the community should take into consideration that there are many people suffering from starvation and it might be better to help people who are in danger of poverty by feeding them extra amounts. In this way, food is not only being made the best use of it but also contributes to preventing being wasted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that the consequences of a society in some places should be maintained and the government should also have a vital role in minimizing the volume of useless contents in meals."}

I personally believe this trend would bring many benefits compared to the drawbacks. \r\n\r\nThere are two significant benefits of children for this argument such as enhancing their knowledge about organic foods and how to treat animals well. To begin with, In modern life, people are bombarded with the advert for fast food which can bring negative impacts on an individual\u2019s health in the long run. This trend can be prevented by raising awareness among young people in terms of plant-based food since they are in primary school. For instance, many entry-level academic institutions equipped their programmes with planting modules. As a result, students know about types of organic vegetables including their nutrients which had a positive impact on their health. Furthermore, children in nature are really curious about some animals, by teaching them how to preserve it will level up their responsibility to take care of animals and raise their awareness about their sense of caring for some endangered animals in the future. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is obvious there are disadvantages to this trend, the safety issue for example, we have seen in modern agriculture usually utilize pesticide chemicals to avoid strikes of insects. This chemical is identified as a hazardous compound which can cause severe dermatitis and eye damage in children as well as the soil also the habitat of several bacteria which can be harmful to children\u2019s health. As an illustration, there are some cases experienced diarrhoea after conducting planting activities in the garden.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, by considering both approaches, I personally feel that the advantage in this aspect has a slight edge over the drawbacks."}

One of the first ways is to educate the public while other groups think this way isn't\r\n\r\n correct.\r\n\r\nThe first group thinks if society knows everything about their daily diet and they understand the positive point about eating a healthy snack like milk, meat, vegetable, yoghurt, water etc, they encourage to eat a healthy meal while there are plenty of factors that a person decides to change their diet.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the population know the effect of diet on their healthy while they don't have enough many don't have a way to exchange their life then\r\n\r\n they follow their life the same as past.\r\n\r\nsecond-team thinks that education isn't enough motivation to people try to alter their daily diet. they believe there are many reasons that government should handle them until the crowd can change their diet and eat healthy food.\r\n\r\nFor example, if government handle the prices of meat, dairy, beans, vegetable etc and try to reduce them until the people's purchasing power will increase and they can eat them then they can receive protein and vitamins etc as a result\r\n\r\n, society has a healthy community.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, I disagree with them because both of them are important. the community will know anything education about healthy diet and they know how they can increase their life span and the government should support the population in prices of products until the crowd can make a good decision about diet."}

According to government funds, some individuals believe that these ought to be spent on numerous facilities, namely transportation, security, education and  healthcare services, whereas other individuals think more money should be spent on works of art. I totally agree with the statement above and I will reveal my ideas in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the society would benefit, if the state provides them with necessary services. By improving the medical sphere, the nation would be healthy and as a consequence, work and study for the development of their own country.        \r\n\r\nMoreover, if the education sphere would be fully funded by the government, the population would continue to develop and compete with other countries, in terms of knowledge.\r\n\r\n Also, looking at public  transportation systems, by spending money on this, the population will not spend cash on private autos, and as a,result the rates of happiness will increase dramatically. Furthermore, in the case that it is safe to live in a particular region and the crime rates are low, it would  appeal to and attract masses of tourists, which might generate a money flow into the country,  as a consequence the state would continue to develop . For instance, islands such as Madagascar, Maldives and Bali  generate 90% of their money from tourism.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in my perspective, the best way to allocate government funds is to serve the basic needs of its population, which may consequently guarantee a vivid and successful future for the whole nation and the country itself."}

Therefore, they do not have any other option.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are some other sides to this view. Students want to study abroad because they know that after graduation they have numerous amount of opportunities in their field job.Moreover, We all know that in a foreign country, in each and every field people get a good job and earn ample amounts of money. Fields like computers have huge demand in  foreign countries. For instance, Students get the opportunity to work in  big companies like Google, Apple and Amazon and reaching on a good post.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the other reason is that they get freedom in  overseas. They do not have to follow social rules and regulations. They can live without any burden on society. Thus, this is the chief reason that people want to live in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, There are some negative points to studying in the other country but on the other hand,they get a good future and freedom in a foreign land as well as they secure their career..

Meanwhile, this gap can be balanced. Both ideas,  along with the conclusion at the end, would be perused in the forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a plethora of causes behind a generation gap and the foremost reason is constantly evolving technology, which is making it hard for  people to cover the generation gap as throughout the globe various new advancements are taking place that are changing the way the masses work at professional as well as personal level. To cite an example, in India, the elderly who are more than 60 years find it difficult to use automobiles and operate  computers because 50 years ago, the technology was not developed completely. Moreover, in the countryside areas, they even do not know how to operate mobile phones. Consequently,  technology is developing at a rapid rate, which makes it difficult for  old people to keep themselves up-to-date with the latest in the industry.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the generation can be covered and balanced by implementing various methods and techniques. The most \r\n\r\nthe dominant way is to run awareness campaigns at public places so that older people who visit these places can be aware of the latest in technology. For this, the higher authorities should come forward. For example, most of the senior citizens visit different public places like gardens, public libraries, and more; when awareness campaigns would be run at such places, the old people will become to know how to operate cars and use laptops.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, although the generation gap is quite long to cover and balance, it can be reduced if all individuals and the legislation take an expedient step to grasp the nettle of this problem. Moreover, the youngsters should assist their grandparents to cover the gap by teaching them how to use automobiles and other things."}

Do the advantages of using the email outweigh the disadvantages?", "content": "A large number of people utilize the email service to carry out their professional tasks and for attending to their personal affairs. While there are some drawbacks associated with using this means of communication, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a potential disadvantage may be misapprehension resulting from an email exchange. Since emotions and tone of speech are, at times, difficult to convey properly through the written form, the content of an email, too, might upset or aggravate someone. For instance, a manager\u2019s announcement could sound forceful when organizing a meeting with the staff through email and frustrate the employees. Another negative is receiving unwanted electronic mail known as spam. These messages contain harmful pieces of virus. I, personally, become rather alarmed when my inbox is cluttered by spam.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a primary advantage of using the email service is fast communication. Whereas in the past, hand-written letters used to take a long time to be delivered, the email technology has made it possible to send and receive mail almost instantly. In business, where people tend to make work-related arrangements on a daily basis, using this service is extremely useful. A further benefit is that the email is accessible in most places around the globe. If one wishes to contact their friends or relatives overseas, there is a good chance that they will be able to connect to the Internet and send an email.\r\n\r\nOn balance, it is true that using emails to exchange information would seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive effects on the speed of communication as well as the accessibility of this service override the downsides."}

In this essay, I will argue that tackling this massive socioeconomic problem requires a significant power at the size of government powers as the authorities have the power of legislation to coordinate these projects as well as unlimited financial resources compared to the private sector.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons for agreeing with the issue of housing shortage being merely solvable by the political authorities is that they have the power of placing executive orders to benefit their attempts. No private sector has this advantage to compete with them; resulting in being the only force capable of handling hindered issues like metropolitan accommodation. For instance, they could allocate a budget from other sectors like the oil industry to spend on housing projects or simply raise taxes in order to gain more money.  By contrast, the private sector lacks such abilities to manage projects to the extent of tackling metropolis housing issues.\r\n\r\nMoreover,  in spite of being cautious about spending their belongings, governments have unlimited resources of income to allocate budgets for possible projects. They have annual income along the lines of trillions of dollars, particularly in developed countries, from sources like tax, natural resources such as fossil fuels, etc., to plan any construction without being wary of their finances running out. The United States, for example, spends more than 5 trillion dollars every year in different schemes to improve their citizen's life. Hence, governments often have large budgets to finance different programs every year.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would argue that states are the sole figures capable of resolving the shortage of housing in big cities on the grounds that they not only have the power of imposing laws and giving orders for their desired objectives but also their number of resources make them the only viable option for significant projects like housing."}

When kids are 5 years old as there a parents are working then it is good for the  children if they go to the  institution. If the   people will go to the  institution very early than they will spend less time with there parents. As they will go to the  schooling then word load will be more on them. For example, a child will go to  the schooling then will learn new things and will meet new people.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there are also some disadvantage of kids who go to institution at early age they are. For example, if the  child will stay at the  house then he will meet less people. Thirdly, if the  people go at 5 years age then the  teacher should give less homework. There should be less study for this students. For  the group its better to go after 6 or 7  years.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, going the  school have both sides advantage and disadvantage. As mentioned above  the parsent should sent there the  children at primary in the age at 6 years. In my opinion, as disuss above go primary after 6 years have more benefits.

Even though being  ignorant, i agree to remain with this selection without a doubt, if i am going to an example about these, there are useful sides to study in special schools. Firstly, they do not face to fall in love with each other by connecting. Their image will be only to develop their career, if it will be separated. Secondly, they manage to achieve  their ambitious easily by choosing  a special school. Such as  I might tell myself.

A good primary education program would not only build the student interest towards studies, it also encourages student to expore more about himself. Primary learning plays a very vital role than the secondary school.\r\n\r\nPrimary educational strategies should also include teaching both national and international language to students. Teaching languages at lower classes is vital for learners. \r\n\r\nThe guidance and teaching for foreign languages such as English, German, Chinese etc,. should be motivated. There are several benefits associated to learning a language at early stage. The primary classes should atleast focus to teach one of the foreign languages. The best strategy is to teach a globally accepted language named as English. When a person will start learning the language from the beginning, he would be able to have a strong grip over the reading, writing, speaking, and listening. In the younger ages, the human brain is more active and is capable of absorbing things. Learning from a low level also helps the student to understand the syntatically and semantically correct meaning of word of language. Moreover, this could also be valuable for the student to increase the vocabulary. \r\n\r\nThe foreign language could be the valueable assets for the people who intend to have a higher education from abroad. In addition, when the person starts his career, he should be capable enough to present his thoughts in words. This would not only help him to settle and get a better job within a country but it might also act as a stroger tool to earn a chance of working in some foreign organization. \r\n\r\nAlong with a lot of pros, there are some cons such as the student might not attentive to learn more about the national language but the benefits linked with the learning and engaging through a foreign language are always greater than learning a secondary level. Secondary level studies should be more focuing towards the direction in which child wants to excel. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, the primary education acts as a base therefore, it is highly recommended to make a learner learn foreign language at primary level rather than secondary standard.

However, I am convinced that affluence is not a reliable barometer of success and a sense of satisfaction along with self-consciousness are of greater importance from my standpoint.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why the concept of success cannot be measured by opulence. To begin with, wealth can be obtained effortlessly. To put it another way, if money is not reaped of hard work, people from high social strata should no longer be admired. Take well-off families who have bequeathed their inheritance to the next generation as an example; their familial financial wealth does not give their children\u2019s success a seal of approval. Secondly, hardly can anyone deny the fact that some massive achievements in life yield a high level of return either too late or never, namely artists and scientists in the history of mankind.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, people can achieve success by deriving great satisfaction as well as introspection. As for contentment, ones, irrespective of their financial status, can flourish, provided that they acquire expertise useful. People can hone skills giving them a competitive edge either in academic or professional fields. A lucid example of this is getting a job they have always dreamed of, thereby finding deep contentment in their life.

What damage does plastic do to the environment and people? What can be done by governments and individuals to solve this problem?", "content": "Plastic pollution has become a critical environmental issue. As the world\u2019s population increases rapidly, so does the amount of disposable plastic in form of soda cans, food wrappers, or bags. This will wreak havoc on both animal species and humans, but if some practices are implemented by the ruling class of countries and individuals, this problem can be addressed. \r\n\r\nPlastic products can put the lives of animals and people in jeopardy. To begin with, foam paper, cups, and food containers are often left on the beaches by many dwellers or holidaymakers. As a result, great quantities of plastic will find their way into sea life, where creatures will either ingest micro-particles or choke on them to death. This, in turn, will upset the food chain as the lives of larger animals in the sea or on the land depend heavily on smaller creatures poisoned by plastic. Plastic also poses a grave threat to humans. Dumping these products in landfills and then burning them is highly likely to release poisonous chemicals that have deleterious effects on human life such as long-term respiratory problems.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, there are ways to address the problem with regard to plastic use. Firstly, the onus is on the government to take meaningful measures to oversee the ways in which plastic is produced. One such measure is to prevent factories from using production methods that are far from environmentally friendly and instead reward those trying to recycle. At the same time, people should also shop more responsibly. When going to a grocery store or a restaurant, they can carry reusable cotton bags, drinking bottles, and cutlery as opposed to disposable ones, thereby promoting the culture of green life while reducing the mass discard of plastic.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, with plastic products continuing to exist in the environment for hundreds of years to come, affecting both animals, sea animals in particular, as well as humans, the government and individuals should make a concerted effort to mitigate the severity of such a crisis."}

Although attending foreign universities than their own countries has many benefits, the drawbacks involved are  important to be discussed.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, it appears that studying abroad proves beneficial. The first benefit is concerned with more opportunities in the target country. Simply put, young people continue their studies in universities where studying is supposed to be more facilitated in comparison with their home country. This in turn paves the way for either academic or professional progress, affecting manifold aspects of their life. An obvious example of this situation is an avid student from a developing country looking for well-equipped laboratories in order to find a cure for hard-curable diseases such as cancer, by which the whole world would no longer be threatened. Students\u2019 networks, moreover, could be enhanced as they collaborate with international peers and academics, thereby boosting the chance of employability in the upcoming opportunities.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the downside of receiving overseas education should not be underestimated. To begin with, if their ideology or race is improperly introduced to the world, non-native students are likely prone to discrimination. As a direct result, all their attempt for integrating into society would fail and they are left with nothing but a traumatic experience. Take a young girl from an Islamic country for example; what may come under fire when she enters the campus with her Muslim-themed appearance is the idea of being a terrorist, permeating other classmates\u2019 minds by the power of media. Another evident disadvantageous side is the high costs of the living in foreign countries, especially progressive ones, such as America. Newcomers should burden the cost of maybe prohibitive tuition fees or accommodation, which were up to their parents heretofore.\r\n\r\nOn balance, the tendency of studying overseas would be both rewarding and problematic. While it may guarantee their future remarkable achievements and provide them with more opportunities, students are highly likely to suffer from harassment as well as financial difficulties."}

What are the reasons and how to solve the problem", "content": "Maintaining a balance between work and other aspects of life has become increasingly challenging for many individuals. This essay explores the reasons behind this struggle and provides effective strategies to address this issue so as to foster a healthier work-life balance.\r\n\r\nSeveral factors contribute to the difficulties in balancing work and life. Firstly, the availability of technological devices and communication tools has blurred the boundaries between professional and personal life. Constant connectivity makes it almost unfeasible to disconnect from work, resulting in extended working hours. Secondly, workplace culture and societal expectations often prioritize productivity and long working hours over personal well-being. Thirdly, personal ambition and the desire to succeed professionally can lead individuals to neglect their personal lives, causing an imbalance.\r\n\r\nTo strive for work-life harmony, one should define specific working hours and create designated spaces for working tasks and relaxation and communicate these boundaries with colleagues and family to manage expectations. Besides, recognizing the importance of self-care activities, such as exercise, hobbies, and spending quality time with loved ones, is the key to reaching equilibrium. People should schedule regular breaks, engage in activities that bring joy and relaxation, and practice mindfulness or meditation to recharge and rejuvenate. What is more, it is crucial to learn how to manage time efficiently by prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and avoiding multitasking. In the meanwhile, one needs to be able to identify time-wasting routines and minimize distractions, maximizing productivity and leaving room for personal activities.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, retaining a work-life balance determines one\u2019s overall happiness. By setting boundaries, prioritizing self-care, and managing time effectively, individuals can create a more balanced and fulfilling life, integrating both personal and professional spheres harmoniously."}

However, cost-effectiveness is a key factor that appears to have a number of proponents. I advocate the former group.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some advocate the idea of more reasonably-priced products. To begin with, having a voracious appetite for shopping affordable goods, people encourage a consumer-driven manufacturing process by which production lines would be expanded. Under this circumstance, more job opportunities could be made and the wheels of industry will be kept turning. An obvious example of this is China, known for its mass production. Not only has it recruited many locals, but also an array of jobs have been developed around the world. Furthermore, supporters of affordable goods claim that class disparity could be less apparent. Simply put, all walks of life would be able to accommodate their needs even the proletariat whose desires have been suppressed.\r\n\r\nHowever, the longevity of goods takes priority in other people\u2019s opinion. The first compelling reason is that a culture of consumerism would no longer be promoted. In other words, when products last for a long time, people, irrespective of their purchasing power, try not to give in to the urge to go shopping. This is clearly delineated in a society where the trend-led approach to purchasing fashion clothing is rejected and replaced by slow fashion, focusing on conscious buying and thoughtful purchases. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between built-to-last items and their positive impacts on the environment. To put it another way, the more sustainable material is used, the less environmentally damaging waste, such as plastic, would be dumped, leading to securing the future of our planet.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I would tend to side with those supporting longevity when it comes to purchasing. It seems to be unreasonable to put the environment in jeopardy by generating more waste and seems more logical to prevent the mass discarding of goods and consumerist culture."}

I firmly believe this statement has positive effects on all family members. In this essay, the causes of this demand and its effects will be discussed.\r\n\r\nSocially, homeownership might project a positive and pleasant image in some cultures. It is psychologically proven that it can definitely give nations more stability and peace of mind. To be more specific it leads to enhancing the level of comfort and welfare in families and individuals who live in their own homes don't need to be worried about their landlord's decision and they are least likely to encounter tough situations in the living place.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in terms of investments folks who purchase places of living will have a reliable source of savings. For instance, the public simply witnessed the families who bought their house, they made a noticeable profit because of inflation in a number of countries the price of buying a house is on the rise. it has been a growing concern for people, therefore people are constantly making an effort to buy a home.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some opponents claim that living in their own homes makes people restricted and decreases their mobility. For example, if their workplace is changed, they could barely change their home and have to drive long-distance to reach their office.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although living in own home might lead to restrictions for folks, I hold the opinion that its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. In fact, it gives people a chance to get away from the tension and stress which may be created by renting a house."}

Some say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Others believe there are benefits to society having more elderly people.", "content": "It is undeniable that the life expectancies of  people are increasing during the last few decades. \r\n\r\nThis is because of the safe habitats and the advanced treatments for various diseases. Though some people believe that these seniors are a burden for the country, some advocacies still exist on their behalf. In my opinion, I think  societies still need the elder public and the way they serve the countries and the families can eradicate the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, these aged people can work with the government and private sectors. Since they are vastly experienced, they can help the authorities in decision makings. For example, during the corona epidemic, the health department of Bangladesh formed an advisory body to monitor the situation and provide  advice. As a result, the number of deaths and infections was relatively low. Additionally, these citizens can be used as trainers in various fields where they will train  youngsters. Furthermore, working parents can leave their children with their grandparents at home safely and can save on the cost of daycare centres. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some public believe that as the elderly population can not work with the regular workforce and take gratuities from the state, they are a burden. Western countries are paying a lot of money for  treatments and food, for example. If the money can be spent on other essential sectors. But since these people had contributed to building the societies, the treatments and other facilities are their rights. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some downsides to having  elders in a great number, but their contributions  still can be regarded positively and that's why I completely disagree with the claim."}

Some people, however, think that we can exercise at home and in parks. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.", "content": "A group of individuals present the view that the gym is the sole place where people can improve their fitness level, whereas others believe that exercising outdoors or even at home is adequate. I strongly agree with the latter opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people justifiably argue that exercising outside the gym is far less stressful. It is certainly true that the gym often puts too much mental pressure on individuals to look good. For example, a few of my friends, who are overweight, recently joined the gym, but quickly terminated their membership contracts because they felt stressed out. They told me that almost everyone there looked lean and self-assured. Indeed, the gym can be a threatening environment to those who wish to exercise without feeling self-conscious. Thus, joining a fitness center is not sensible for many people who may be insecure about their weight or physical abilities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group of people claim that one needs special exercise machines and state-of-the-art equipment to improve their fitness. They insist that people cannot exercise properly without employing a personal trainer, available at the gym. However, I am not convinced by this argument since most forms of exercise can be performed elsewhere too. Jogging, which is a cardiovascular exercise and recommended by doctors, can be done in parks. Also, people can engage in weight-bearing exercise such as push-ups and planks in the home.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my view, we do not have to join the gym in order to be physically active. Some individuals could even be demoralized by going to a fitness center since they would feel the pressure to look attractive and strong. People, instead, can perform numerous exercise routines at home or in the park without the undue stress experienced at the gym."}

What is your opinion about this?", "content": "Mostly the restrictions are imposed in the early teenages. Through this passage, I got an opportunity to share my opinion regarding the teenage curfew. \r\n\r\nAs it has been noted, there are several area in the US where the children in their younger ages are not allowed to leave their place during certain the hours of a day. There are two schools of thoughts for this security condition. Firstly, a few people believe controlling children in their early ages plays a significant role in building a strong personality of child. It is necessary to apply curfew conditions due to the reason the kids at this age start to think they are more powerful. Moreover, they may also take bold steps, in addition, sometimes they may indulge themselves in bad things. Furthermore, these bad steps could be the utlizating drugs and stealing items from others. Additionally, they may find it appealing to group up with the gangsters. At this age they might not be able to understand and correct their bad actions themselves rather they need a support from their elders siblings, parents, teachers, and the law enforcement agencies. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this innitiative is very important. As far as i think, all the countries should enforce curfew during a fixed time. This would be a great effort to stop people from developing bad habits. Moreover, through this, there will be huge decrease in crime rate of a region. The government should heavily fine the kid and the parent who breaks the law. Because law enforcement is only way to control the teenage residents of country from taking worst actions."}

This is due to the fact that most people find shopping as an experience which makes a difference in their day to day life. Some people find themselves in a different world, surrounded by various material things which they may or may not be able to purchase. Even if they are not able to finance these, they find much pleasure in looking and feeling these things and Imagining owning them some day, some people go shopping when they really want to purchase things and they prefer to look around and compare the prices before buying them. I think most people love to go shopping because, then they could meet friends, make contacts with people, and get to know what is in the latest trend. It provides them a pleasant distraction from their routine and sometimes dull life.\r\n\r\nThe most important effect shopping has on an individual is that it nourishes the self-esteem. An individual may find the social contact most gratifying and this makes people come out of their shells and be more extrovert. Purchasing something, as well as knowing that you are financially able to purchase something give more self confidence to people.\r\n\r\nThe increase in popularity to go shopping has many effects on the society. People may be encouraged to go into new businesses and it will improve the economy. More job opportunities will be created for people in these businesses. Encouraged by the increase of popularity manufacturers will try to improve their products, so that the consumers can have a wide range of products at competitive prices. The overall quality of the product as well as the services provided by the sales staff will be improved.\r\n\r\nMore job opportunities will be created in advertising as the manufacturers try to sell their product.

What do you think is driving this trend? Is this a good or bad development?", "content": "At present, the trend of exploring international cuisines and food from other culture has been on a rise compared to trying the local food. The constant exposure of Internet and social media and increasingly affluent society have made remarkable differences to this proliferating trend. The essay will discuss the factors that drive this trend as well as the benefits of the development.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the easy access to internet and social media have given the constant exposure to different culture and traditions covering the cuisines too.  A significant number of people especially youngsters are attracted and curious to explore various ethnic food and practices. For instance, the food blogger Irfan from Chennai has garnered million followers to his food vlog videos where he travels to different countries to equip people with knowledge on various food items and the cuisines. This trend   provides plethora of benefits to the tourism industry by attracting millions of visitors to travel. In addition, the cutting- edge technology and readily available information on websites exacerbate the interest of many to explore and taste.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the increasing affluence of the society can be another factor to look forward to explore and feast on international cuisines compared to local food which is ubiquitous everywhere.   As we all know Singapore being the food paradise in Asia, the tourists are being  drawn to  the number of restaurants there. To epitome, the high -class restaurants and five star hotels in Singapore provide wide range of  international  buffets and array of local food items from all over the world to entice the hungry crowd. The melting pot of local culture in Singapore is also of utmost importance to build good bond and friendship with others.     \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, the support for local food as well as the   exploration of international cuisine fetch benefits to both people and country.  By embracing different ethnic groups from other countries   and   local culture, we can build a sustainable future in this shrinking world."}

Do the benefits of these measure outweigh the drawbacks?", "content": "Recently, in some countries, an increasing number of offenders is posing a threat to the society. Hence, more and more security cameras, surveilance equipments are prevail application in large urban areas to protect innocent people. This arrangement, despite seemingly disadvantageous in certain aspects, actually possesses merits that, in my opinion, would overshadow the drawbacks.\r\n\r\n    Regarding the drawbacks of using security cameras to deter crime, some people belive that the police has invaded their own privacy, and freedom. These days, the extensive of using special surveilance equipments is hardly escapable, to the point that the people may find themselves surrounded by those every walking moment. It does not matter where they are, they still being watched for 24 hours. Whether they are on the street, in the supermarket, or on a way home, images of their faces and their movement will be recorded and sent to the security organisations, ready to be analysed if necessary. Many people belive their right, their privacy are not be respected, and this action would be a violation of privacy. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn spite of the above arguments, I\u2019m inclined to think the pros outweigh the cons. First and foremost, the most overwhelming advantage is that police can easily track the criminals once an individual commit an offence. Those devices can deter young offenders or potential criminals from breaking the laws, because they know that themselves being under the surveilance of cutting-edge devices. Furthermore, it would greatly contribute to reducing terrorist attacks, thanks to the data and images from these cameras, which are used to detect unusual activities of any individual in public places. The installation of more video cameras in urban areas is cost effective, and unobtrusive, while the goverment do not have to allocate too much money on the police forces. More importantly, this application will protect the society from any threat and provide a sense of safety and security to the people.\r\n\r\n  In a nutshell, the use of surveilance cameras as crime detterance is being increased in many big cities around the world. I hold the view that this application bring more merits than drawbacks, albeit objection of some people."}

This essay will discuss about many elements that affect significantly to the travelling demand and shed light on the advantages of travelling for the voyagers\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are multiple reasons explain why tourism is attracted recently. Initially, in this era, because of the industrialzation and modernisation, the aviation is more developing, there are more and more domestic and international flights around the world, also due to the innovation of cheap air travels so that payment for a trip is much more affordable and more dwellers can easily get those economical tickets.

Therefore, countries are investing much of their gross domestic income in agriculture. However, despite the improvement of the farming industry ,some places in the world still suffer from the food insecurity. In this essay we will look into the fact behind this and we will discuss solution for the above problem.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we should look into the fact why the food cultivation industry is still not cater evenly around the globe. Even though, the industrial development with advanced machineries available in developed-countries ,those are not evenly distributed among developing and poor income countries. On top of that, some countries are suffering from conflict for ages which in turn collapse the economy and food security. As well as, political instability is a  a huge added fact to this problem. In some places, poor decision making by the government make collapse in the cultivation field. For example, few years  in Sri Lanka suddenly banned all the chemical peptisides without gradually withdrawing it. Eventually, country suffered from a tremendous food shortage within one year. Although, facilities are available, poor decision making can trigger starvation in some areas of the globe.\r\n\r\nTo overcome   this problem, first there should be concrete agricultural policies which cannot be changed by the politicians. Other than that governing authorities should invest more on building infrastructure for agronomy. However, without proper workforce machineries are invain. Hence, educating the people involved with farming and generating new graduate graduates in crop-science field would be a long term solution for this problem.\r\n\r\n In conclusion, educating farmers and strengthening them with newer technological infrastructure would strength the food industry. While, they should be supported with the concrete policies not to cheat by the corrupt politicians or intermediary sellers .Consequently, this would strengthen the food security and get rid from the hunger in the world."}

Whereas, science and technology made our lives easy by all means. In the past people have to travel for week to reach their destination, but science and technology makes it far easy by airplanes,trains,buses,cars and bikes. The travel that can take weeks in the past is now taking some hours.\r\n\r\nHistory is a subject that is able to consistently reminds us about the struggle of our ancestors. The struggle for independence. The struggles for keeping the countries safe. Moreover, some people are very fond of reading history books, and learning about their culture and customs.\r\n\r\nScience and technology are the subjects that keeps us connected to the modern world.

Firstly, unified management of traffic fees and try to adjust them to a generally accepted range. And also, the government can propose for ride on a bicycle when traveling. Secondly, the state can provide some housing welfare, and decrease resident\u2019s economic pressure. For instance, it can offer free rooms for families with many children.

Despite that, many areas in the world still suffer from the lack of fresh water to use. This essay will discuss the cause and the way to solve the challenge.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, the water pollution is caused mostly by the trash dumping of the residents and the contaminated chemicals that are flushed away by the factories. Not only the cause of the garbage but also the awareness of people who always have a mindset that there will be cleaner to help them, but these activities will contribute significantly to the lack of fresh water in every place and can easily damage daily life.\r\n\r\nTo help reduce the problem, the main solution is to punish all the individuals and groups who dumped trash and chemicals into the water resources, which will decrease the rate of water pollution in the society. Then the government should help the people by installing the water filter in every household. This will make every family access to fresh water and no more worry about health when drinking contaminated water. Also the government should schedule filter changes every 6 months to retain the fresh water to all the families. Moreover, people should also raise other awareness by telling the benefits of having fresh water to the health of everyone. Or even set up a fresh water station in the public which is easier to access the clean water.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the cause of water shortage is mainly about the people and groups that pollute the sources and the main solution is to increase awareness and make more ways to help every people access to the cleaning water."}

I believe that even if the education would go fully online, the teacher would still be neededFor example, during the lockdown, a lot of people were forced to switch to distant studying, and then it turned out that this is quite convenient. There is also an opinion that in 30 years a lot of professions will be replaced by robots and machines. Some people even believe that a teacher will not be needed - all knowledge will be able to flow directly to a person&#39;s brain by using the latest technologies. I cannot agree with such a statement as I think that a teacher is necessary anyway \u2013 you cannot find out all the needed details of a certain subject yourself.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I believe that it will not be possible to completely replace the teacher as it is much more pleasant to study having communication with a human, not a robot.

I personally prefer to live in a hotter environment, and in this essay, I will make an explanation and discuss the two standpoints mentioned above.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are several advantages to live in hot climate. One benefit is that many outdoor activities. Take climbing, biking and jogging for example, these three exercises will be easier to do when the weather is great, and thanks to the long daytime, those who take part in these activities may have a better sight while doing them. Secondly, a higher heat often leads to a higher possibility to sweat. Admittedly, sweating may make people smell disgusting and feel uncomfortable; however, as everyone knows, it is undoubtedly an efficient way to help our bodies burn the unwanted fat. According to the World Health Organization, those who sweat more could stay in fit much easier since their sweat glands stay active most of the time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, from the perspective of the proponents of cold weather, they will choose to live in a cooler region because of the reasons below. Firstly, the storage of food may be much easier since the temperature degree is suitable to keep them fresh. Furthermore, with a lower temperature degree, the world become quitter and make people feel calm when working.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the benefits of cold weather, I would like to stay in hot climate region instead because I am a lover of outdoor activities, and I can not stand wearing too many clothes at one time which may make me look fatter."}

However, many students after completing their under graduate studies from home college, majority of them going to apply for further degree or certification course in US, UK or Canada. In addition, if we compare state university to other foreign university, both will either lack proficiency in sort of education or expertises in providing them. But, foreign country will provide golden opportunity of internship program for students. As a result, many would discover new aspect in their lives, also benefits after receiving international degree.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some international programs will need to compete entrance exam, whenever students will return after their studies back to home county. Whereas, medical field in India and other continents have entrance exam for international students. If they are willing to get certification of doctors training and practices. For instance, this could create some negativity in community, who will get neglected to practice before proper examination.

Yet some fields would still get benefits of their degree.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, any student with international degree will have high probability to get a job, in compare to other individual.

Nonetheless, their skills and hardworks often remain unrecognizable because it is hardly accepted and appreciated by their male counterparts. Therefore, women sometimes feel less motivated and even reluctant to persue their career and explore their talent. Mostly in the rural area for example, women confine themselves in the four walls of home and do not want to participate in the society and economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, women's achievement are very rarely celebrated by men because the patriarchal society always posseses a dominating attitudes towards women and they know very well that if women have a plenty of opportunities, they can also be their better partner not only in real life but also in the society.

First of all, elderly people are not very adaptive and creative as youngers are and they do not very energetic to do work like younger. They may find some difficulties with usage of technology and to fulfill the requirements of company which could affect on their health and they might suffer both physically and psychologically. Older people have more difficulties to find a job even when they have same qualifications as younger and have experience also. While, some employers prefer older people with higher working experience rather than younger who have just graduated and having no work experience and good communication skills.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem government should take some initiative in effective way. Government should encourages self-employment for fresh graduates so they can create job opportunities themselves. Then the retirement age should be decreased which reduce the pressure of competition the young have to face. Another possible way is to allocate more money to pension system because who find their pension sufficient for a living will not have to find a work. Moreover, younger people and government should support older person to use new technologies so they can do work well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some problems occur in competition of youth and old to get job like technology and experience related but it can be solved by taking some measures like decrease retirement age and increase pension."}

Despite some struggles at the beginning, the start-uppers may become successful and create job opportunities for other people. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on work depends on willingness of the boss. Whether they work hard and long, and consequently earn lots of money, or they might shorten their working hours and as a result reduce their income, whereas in large companies, people only have an hourly salary, and it does not matter, whether they do their best at work or have worked extra, they will have the appointed salary. Moreover, there  are some people who can not work under someone's control, they want to have financial freedom and become independent, working on theirselves.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, the self-employed individuals may face some difficulties at the real beginning of developing their business. Although, the bosses need to work extra in order to become successful at the opening stage of their business, however as their companies grow, the risks of losing everything might cause health problems for individuals. For instance, the recent investigation has demonstrated that, 9 out of ten companies become bankrupt in the first five-year period.

Some people believe that given them a punishment is vital to help them to grow and learn the difference. I strongly agree with this mentallity because children will become adults and need to follow society's rules and parents and teachers should remove toys or phones that children love to punish them to allow them learn good behaviour.\r\n\r\nChildren need to learn the difference between right and wrong at very early age because they will become adults who need to follow society's rules. Firstly, when children learn at early age that means  not following rules, this will led them to no valuable items such as toys, cellphones or watchin TV. As result, they learn the importance of following parent's rules. Also, they experience what means to be rejected by parents or teachers because they did not follow instructions, so these type of behaviour is similar with adult's rules. Foe instance, in The United Statesm if people do not follow trafic rules, they might get a ticket and need to pay a fine, and if they do not pay the bill, they might go to prison.\r\n\r\nParents and teachers should punish children when they do not follow instructions, and one way is to removing valuable itmes such as cellpones or not having the privilige to watch a TV program. To begin with, learning the importance of follow directions at early age, allow them to think the difference of not be part of a system. However when children do not follow direccions, they need to suffer some consequences like going to bed without dessert, so they might feel pain for not enjoy life like the rest of the children. To illustrate, in most countries, parents punish their children by giving them thinking time when they do not obey at home, and this help children to have time and think for a way to apologize and learn from having a bad behaviour.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is vital for children to learn what is acceptable or what is not at early age to allow them to learn how human beings behave in a society because later on these children will be adults as well. More importantly, parents and teachers should help to disciplinate these kids at home and at schools, so they can have a better understanding of the importance of beahave well. If children are not punish at early age, they migh encounter difficult to adapt to society."}

In my opinion, I believe that these changes can bring a number of advantages ; however, their drawbacks are more significant.\r\n\r\n     It is acknowledged that the availability of tertiary education without tuition fees can have several positive impacts on  individuals and society. This is because thanks to such education available, more people have the opportunity to study specialized knowledge, thus they probably enhance their lives with a tertiary degree to get a job with a high salary and it also contributesto  a more educated workforce to countries. Moreover, the provision of free-of-charge education could create a balanced opportunity for all students, especially for poor students who cannot afford to study at university due to prohibitively expensive tuition fees. As a result, these changes may improve the country's economy and bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.\r\n\r\n     However, this line of reasoning is flawed because of the long-term dire consequence on the country\u2019s development of these changes. To be specific, everyone entitled to university will reduce the competition among individuals so it will make them less motivated to try and improve their academic ability to pursue university education.Besides, the free-college policy can cause students who study at university lose the motivation to study hard. Consequently, the bachelor\u2019s degree will lose its value and even the quality of education in university can be affected significantly, resulting in a reduction in the ability of the workforce which has a key role in the development of a country . In addition, the part of the budget allocated to other aspects such as the transport system, economy and health system will be spent on education, leading to tax hikes and social welfare reduction, meaning the standard of living of residents will be affected.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I believe that the government should not implement the availability of tertiary education without tuition fees because of its risks."}

Many talents of every human being are unknown and should be known through experience in different fields.

If you do not have any knowledge or talent in various fields such as music or art, with regular effort and good and educated teachers, you have a greater chance of success.

Frequent and regular effort can be much better than empty talent because you know and strengthen your weaknesses with practice.\r\n\r\nIn short, talent plays a significant role as long as you know them.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "According to some folks, private lessons are more efficient; however, a group of people think that public tutoring is more beneficial. This essay will elaborate on both views and my opinion favoring the latter proposition.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, individuals choose personal classes for an array of reasons. The first and foremost key reason is that they better understand any topic or subject. It is due to their comfort level with asking any questions they have. They do not feel comfortable and are rather shy to ask their teachers to repeat a lesson if they do not get a proper idea about that topic when other students are there because they think those people will make fun of them for a silly question. They are not bothered by this type of problem if they enroll in private classes; therefore, they can ask multiple times, and by doing this, they will have an in-depth understanding of the lesson, which will help them during their exams in achieving higher grades. For instance, it is observed that the toppers who have secured higher ranks had private classes to prepare for their examinations. Moreover, it is undoubtedly true that personal coaches can appropriately train their learners. They can focus individually and perfectly, even on simple methods, since they have more time to guide them. Most parents, for instance, choose private sports trainers for their kids to make sure about the decent personal techniques provided by the trainers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some hold a view that group training has adequate merits for various reasons. Firstly, they will get a chance to learn from the other\u2019s doubts. In simple words, if a number of trainees are involved in coaching, there are chances of several queries from individuals, and to solve their doubts, an educator will have to go for back-and-forth. Through this activity, all learners will have better knowledge about the topic because of a plethora of revisions. Secondly, it is affordable for most people. It is undoubtedly true that public tutorials charge less than private ones, and hence most guardians of juveniles who have low income can afford them. Thirdly, it can improve the basic skills of group class takers. To put it simply, one can have abundant chances to communicate with fellow members, and also they can help each other to clear their doubts. By doing this, they will have the skill of teamwork, which will help them in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion to the aforementioned statements, it can be stated that both views have some merits; however, in my opinion, people should select the group classes because it is more advantaegous than the private classes."}

This is because teachers face challenges to maintain discipline among of children reuslt of increase the number of students in the classrooms. For example, in some school in Saudi Arabia teachers teach over 50 students , which means teachers unable to deal with a huge number of students. Violence in the social media is another reason why unacceptable behaviour increase among students. This is due to the face that, children watch  violent images on social media platform namely, Facebook, and  Twitter. Therefore, children will copy what they see on the social media and  apply it on the classrooms on school. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many actions can taken by the government to addressing this problem. The first effective measure, the government should provide more funding for education sector  in order to build more school, which this step can contribute to reduce the number of students on classrooms. As a result, it  will become more easy for teachers to maintain  discipline among pupils. Prohibited violent images on social media is another efficient measure to mitigate misbehaviour of pupils.

Be that as it may, I completely disagree with this common view. One should certainly be enjoying their work, which should simultaneously be their passion. The following paragraphs will explore my personal perspective.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that stability is ensured once an adult secures a position in a high-paying corporation. Precisely, the basic office job which pays the bills, keeps the children\u2019s tummies full, and affords good education. However, why would an individual follow a career path predetermined for them, in which their success has a definite limit? Moreover, most workers are depressed by how they spend their 9 AM-5 PM hours, but are brainwashed into believing it is the best way. In such a scenario, we must take a step back, and question what makes life worth living. A huge portion of one\u2019s week lacks any hint of joy, and that is a conscious choice on their part. While those 40 hours are naturally filled with hard work, one is free to choose whether it is for a desk job for a company that does not care about employees, or for a passion.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, large companies justify cruel treatment to their employees due to the amount of money they are paid. The most important lesson I have learnt in my lifetime is that no amount of cash can buy dignity. Thus, everyone should be treated with the utmost respect and consideration. In addition to that, when you have motivation and drive to achieve your dream occupation, you are more likely to. Certainly, you will not be glowing with determination in a position you dislike. Thus, once you do succeed in your preferred path, you kill two birds with one stone. On top of that, remember that life is not worth living without bliss. The fear to dismiss a conventional method is prevalent among society. Nonetheless, anyone brave enough to contradict the rules never regrets it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is true that conventional ways guarantee basic life needs and some other things every now and then. Nevertheless, no individual should be held captive by a corporation that redeems them as expendable. Turning your fantasies to reality require resilience and patience, but it is worth it. Thereafter, colors become vibrant as they once were in childhood. Ultimately, I disagree with the perspective of the majority. Bliss is undoubtedly of more value than income."}

Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it as valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities. What is your opinion?", "content": "The task at hand is asking you to give an opinion on the question if students should part-take in paid work. Working for money is the wrong approach in some people's eyes, whereas it's crucial for learning and taking responsibility for others. Personally, I strongly agree with the latter and think it is very valuable. It gives you a better understanding of the reality in the workplace, as well as helping you to immediately apply theoretical concepts in practice and learn from the experience.\r\n\r\nFirstly, working while studying gives you great insight that you cannot always deliver work of perfect quality and that you sometimes have to take shortcuts. I've also seen this at my workplace a lot of times. There were strict deadlines set up and we had to descope work in order to hit the delivery date. Coming back to the question, this is important learning and teaches you about taking responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it fosters you to apply theoretical concepts learned in university to real-life work situations. This case happens a lot to me, since I am working three days a week next to my studies.\r\n\r\nUsually, I am able to use programming design patterns, which I practised in school, in a much larger codebase at work. Connecting to the question, doing paid work helps me to increase my understanding of concepts and pushes me to learn more.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, my opinion on the topic is that I value getting paid for work very much. This is mostly due to the reason that it helps me to understand the work-life better and it allows me to immediately try out the concepts learned in school, which further strengthens my understanding."}

This has caused many people to be affected by \"fuel poverty\". Outline the situation and problem of fuel poverty.

Many people are now experiencing \"fuel poverty\" as a result of this. According to Jones, (2023) Being unable to spend enough money to heat your home sufficiently is known as fuel poverty. Low income, high fuel prices, and inefficient energy use are the root causes. \r\n\r\n\u0130t is known that living in cold and damp places has some problems. Firstly, the problem is without Insulation homes, In a study by Lynos (2023), a home with a lack of insulation can cost \u20ac1,368 more to heat annually than a home with enough insulation.  Secondly, The main factor behind rising energy bills is the rising cost of polluting forms of energy like gas and oil. Thirdly, people need fair pricing for fuel. According to, Nickless (2023) the price of energy decreases as you consume more of it under the current pricing system. As a result, individuals with the lowest earnings pay the highest energy costs since they consume the least, while the rest of us pay the bill for the rich's expensive lifestyle.\r\n\r\nOverall, the first possible solution, The \u00a3360 increase in the typical energy bill over the past ten years was mainly due to the increased cost of gas. The only option to permanently reduce costs is to quickly switch from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy produced by the sun, wind, and waves. The second possible solution is using a fair pricing system, According to Nickless (2023), this would lower the costs of supplying the essential energy needed for cooking, heating, and lighting while also acknowledging that these needs ought to be treated as human rights. Thirdly, According to Winser (2023), artificial intelligence can now be an essential tool in the struggle against fuel poverty. The project uses modern Al software to combine data from several sources. This data is displayed in a simple way that highlights which houses in London and the southeast of England could require more help. Last but not least, To assist minimize energy waste and reduce costs, the government ought to sponsor a street-by-street insulation program.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Sandiford and McRae (2023) estimate that 8.4 million people will be living in fuel poverty by the time costs rise in April 2023, a rise from the charity National Energy Action's (NEA) current estimate of 6.7 million.  There are a lot of people who are suffering and the biggest help should come from governments. According to Lynos (2023), Nobody ought to be forced to decide between heating their home and putting food on the table. This should also involve help from the government for those in need."}

From my perspective, this trend has some potential detrimental impacts on children. \r\n\r\nThere are immense reasons for the phenomenon. Firstly, a large number of functions and applications are integrated into the cell phones. Young individuals with curiosity by nature, they are easily attracted by simulation games, renewable functions and some similar ones. In addition, the growing dominance of social networks is one of the reasons leading to a long concentration span of children on the mobiles. To illustrate, a wide range of entertaining and studying resources make children willing to spend a long time discovering and updating the latest information and knowledge. For example, Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in Vietnam, where everyone can access any given subject or even keep contact with their friends in a far-off distance. \r\n\r\nThere are some adverse effects which are accompanied by the phenomenon. First of all, a numerous number of young generations lack interpersonal skills, especially communication skills. This is because they spend too much time in the virtual world and just talk with others via texting instead of verbal communication. For instance, if a youngster gets accustomed to communicating by texting, he will struggle to talk with his friends in real-world conversation. Secondly, children\u2019s physical health can be threatened because of a lack of outdoor activities. The young immerse in virtual video games inside the cell phones, they sacrifice invitations of physical activities with their friends, parents and other people. Gradually, a sedentary lifestyle is established, which may result in obesity of the young generation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that children have a vast number of reasons to use the smartphone, however I firmly hold the view that excessive reliance can lead to some negative effects."}

There could be divergent factors leading communities to starvation. Firstly,natural disasters can lessen fertilization of the soil, thereby reducing harvest.For example, the main issues that most of  Africa\u2019s regions are dealing with are likely to be drought and lack of water supplies.This causes challenges for farming and harvesting productively.Secondly,despite proper agricultural fields,some political measurements like war or lack of policies in order to use tech and financing through agricultural sectors can pave the path toward poverty.\r\n\r\nThere are some strategies to wrestle with these challenges.From my personal perspective, global Institutions like UNICEF or WHO could enforce quite laws in order to make methods of new-tech agriculture mandatory.Countries like Russia or Iran  have investments through political issues rather than other vital sectors like farming  which result in increasing poverty inside society and fewer crops to cultivate or in markers. Moreover, if authorities use new industrial methods like lab-agriculture and make funding through this way ,even in devastating floods or droughts in which crops fail,production is continuing."}

Although children might lose focus in classrooms, I believe that they allowed to bring their phones due to safety aspect.  \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, in learning schemes, phones make kids easily distracted as they contain games that addictive. Moreover, children nowadays very excel in accessing information and in operating their smart phones. It could hindering them in not only giving attention to their teachers, but also doing something inapproproate. In addition, kids do not have sense of responsibility and good emotional management. To illustrate, there is a pupil who record a teacher while teaching and it went viral on social media, it really against teacher rights by sharing their privacy. Furthermore, it could be argues that forbiding children to use phones in school environment could lighten teacher\u2019s job. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, allowing kids to bring phones to schools has, therefore, been implemented as a policy that would help teachers\u2019 workforce. If kids using their phones in schools, it would be easy for them to communicate with their parents. Nowadays, there are many criminal activities targeting pupils, and indeed the parents are worried concerning this issue. The majority of schools in Asia, for instance, support children to bring their phone, even though they did not agree with that in the first place. The reason of that is the parents there gather to pushed and argued the schools due to childrens\u2019 safety. Consequently, the schools agree as it could prevent any crimes that might happen to pupils. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while phones could make students distracted, it enables them to contact their family regarding to their condition and position.

Thirtfs choice has drawbacks, and there are several ways to encourage adolescents to socialise offline, which will be discussed in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some of the most common reasons for teenagers communicating online are the convenience and time it might provide, which are unlimited. Unlike meeting offline, which requires them to spend not only their time, but also their energy, they need a lot of preparation to meet someone, whereas communicating in social media only need their fingers and they can deliver their feelings as quickly as they can.  That means that adolescents nowadays do not have more experiences meeting people as they did not want to try something outside their comfort zone, which could potentially decrease their life skills. Consequently, they did not have a well-prepared strategy due to interact with people older than them or important people who will help them in the future. \r\n\r\nDespite the obvious demerits, there are two strategies in terms of promoting social skills in adolescence. The first is by strengthen the communities. Society ought to provide an entertaining and supporting place concerning something they love, for instance, a well-known muscisian, series genre, until a book club. Secondly, social communities could hold volunteer projects. Unlike the previous reason, this one will touch their heart and move to help others. If they see an advertisement that contain poor conditions, they will do something and be productive. Moreover, they will give something based on their passion, which can thus increase their social skills to another level.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while technological advancement has played a pivotal role in the way teenagers interact with each other, it will hinder them from having active life skills, including empathy for others. Therefore, I remain firmly convinced that the drawbacks could be tackled by communities based on hobby and volunteer activities."}

According to this,  people should individually be working. \r\n\r\nFor the first point, firstly, the official environmental office should keep  issuing relevant measures. Secondly, they should control the smoke coming out of diesel cars. For this, the people running such vehicles should be banned and charged a heavy amount. Thirdly,  fireworks usage should be stopped.

In addition, dust and maintenance while raining should also be given a considerable amount of attention. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the second way is associated with every resident.

In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and give my point of view.\r\n\r\non the one hand, there are many reasons behind it why parents should keep an eye on their children during teenage. Firstly, at this age, young generations have less experience than their parents. if parents do not stop their children to take a wrong decision, then they may face difficulties in the future.\r\n\r\nFor instance, some youngsters take their decision about their education as influenced by their friends or classmates. As a result, in the coming time, they are not able to get marks in their studies, because they do not have an interest in their fields. Secondly, parents have the right to keep an eye on their children.\r\n\r\nSo, they can become successful persons in their lives. For example, nowadays, most teenagers spend their time on social media as compared to  their education. As a result, at a later ,age they do not have any skill or degree to get a job in the competitor era. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, It is suggested by people that parents should give freedom to their children. So, they can make their decision according to their choice. Such as decisions regarding choosing their subjects in high school education. Apart from this, it will also help  offspring to become independent and confident individuals. Last but not  least, conflicts only create disburden amongst families. so, they should avoid conflicts and spend quality with each other.\r\n\r\nAccording to my point of view, conflicts always create misunderstanding between both parents and children. Therefore, decisions should be made by both parents and youngsters together. In this way, they can both keep away from tension and stress.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, even though different people give different statements about conflicts during teenage between parents and young people.

From my perspective, this situation could create serious issues people's health, for uneducated person who use alternative medicine to treat people can harm themselves and the other because of their a lack of knowledge of medical subjects. Therefore, the improvment of alternative medicine has huge negative effects on patient's lives.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, development in medicine has gradually caught on all over the world and many scientists sacrifise their lives to find treatments for some disease which has high-level mortality such as cancer. These professionals have to call for many skills to graduate from medical school. However, look at the other sides, people who use alternative medicine (including herbal medicine, and acupunture) do not have even a certificate. Hence, patients who believe fake doctors endanger their lives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no evidence about the treatment of alternative medicine. Additionaly, when making a treatment with herbals, mixing some plants could be toxic for human body. If people take this medicine, their bodies might be damaged irreversibily. Moreover, this medical condition may be unfixed by the doctors due to a lack of scientific research.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the main disadvantage of alternative therapies is that it could be a powerful gun with no real doctors.

In this way, children can learn from other children and develop some social norms and reduce their self-centred nature. Still, I do not agree with this set of people.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, some people believe that children should occupy themself with their own useful tasks because by doing so they can be more productive. If kids would spend their time studying well or learning some indoor skills such as cooking, reading or playing indoor games with siblings then they can be more personalised rather  be less focused by participating in group activities. In addition, to be personalised children can obey their parents' instructions and can not have bad habits by following peers in a group, which also makes them productive by not wasting their time on unuseful tasks such as gossiping with friends or criticizing  someone. Thus, my inclination with this set of people  is because being more centralized and personalised can help  a child to learn how to value their precious time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although being social and being a team player can be learned by participating in a group activity,  making an effort in a personalised development keep children focused and productive."}

Some people believe that banks should apply the strict role of using credit cards. However, credit cards come with many advantages and thus I do not agree with that. In the following, we will deliberate more impressive usage of credit cards. \r\n\r\nOne of the most advantages of credits card provide us with a convenient way of transactions and buying. It's a very comfortable and accessible way. However,people misuse this feature and may buy not nesseccary items, which leads individuals to get into a debut. However,responsible spending should be learned and taught to decrease the percentage of overspending instead of strictly issuing of credit cards. Credit cards are very essential ,especially in emergency situations and hence is not practical for banks to limit using them to persons only who are able to clear the debt. Thus, the efficient way to reduce the rate of overuse is learning people to be more realistic when using credit cards. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are many factors that lead individuals to incur debts such as loans , and unexpected life circumstances such as job loss and medical needs. All of the previous factors can lead individuals to borrow money and fall into heavy debt. Hence, restricting the use of credit cards could not solve the issue of increasing the rate of debt completely. In terms of financial situations, responsible actions and usage is the most useful way to prevent financial strains and falling into heavy debts. Credit cards are a profound way and  more practical than cash usage  hence banks could not stop using credit cards.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, credit cards are a very convenient and practical financial tool. Furthermore, it is very essential in emergency situations. Hence, I totally disagree that banks should restrict credit cards to only  responsible individuals."}

Because the internet plays a significant role in our life, we use it for a whole time. Also, the smartphone is very convenient to take, they easily read newspapers online anytime.

However, the government wants to give access to companies for finding more resources from undiscovered areas. A large group of people think in its favour. While others have the opposite opinion. The upcoming paragraphs will shed light on my personal opinion with a suitable example.\r\n\r\nI agree with the statement nowadays, oil and gas are demanding and there are not enough resources to fulfil the requirements in the future. There are numerous reasons why I am in favour of it. The most important reason is the consumption of oil and gas at the top of the list. In other words, all over the world oil and gas is the main thing that uses globally. Moreover, to fulfil future requirements the government should be allowed to open undiscovered areas for searching new resources of oil and gas. It means that with the help of new discoveries, people fulfil their needs in the future. I would like to give a reason to explain my perspective. Further, everything depends on oil and gas to justify my perception, I would like to give an example of a serve which use conducted by Sydney University in 2014. The survey revealed the findings that oil and gas are directly proportional to the inflation.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, some people oppose the above statement for several reasons, because they believe that gas and oil should be replaced with new technologies. In addition, nowadays, many companies are making electric cars to reduce the consumption of oil and gas. Tesla is the biggest company to manufacture electric cars. Furthermore, solar panels have also introduced in the world to fulfil the requirements in lieu of oil and gas.     \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, according to the arguments aforementioned above.

The buyer has to be smarter and more practical to avoid this conflict as at the end of the day the consumer only needs the item which is more useful not the more decorated.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, The manufacturers have a point and this decoration will help them in getting more money as the buyer most of the time tends to buy good-looking items regardless of what is the item but still, The seller has this part of responsibility where he has to be more conservative and using less packaging as much as he can.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, The buyer and the consumer have the same responsibility not only towards themselves but also towards the environment as the buyer has to be more practical and so does the seller."}

Next, the current  is passed to the inverter, which turns it into AC and regulates the supply of electricity. This supply goes directly to the electrical panel where the current is distributed throughout the whole house.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth step shown on the diagram, a utility meter in the home is responsible for conducting the excessive solar electricity power  outside the home through the grid. Finally, if the solar power does not provide enough supply, the electricity will flow back by the utility grid into the household through the meter."}

This movement allows students to enjoy their best learning experiences as well as accumulate multiple vital knowledge to develop their personal growth. This report will indicate all of the reasons to analyze the necessity of being a positive role model at school. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, being a good role model encourages every pupil to pick some figures who have exceptional qualities including confidence, assertiveness, leadership and sociality to inherit from them. This course of action can inspire students to gain valuable life lessons in order to educate children about moral and immoral behaviours, and become a responsible, respectful adult who is willing to make enormous contributions to society. For illustration, the majority of students spend 12 years interacting with plenty of individuals within the school campus and learning from people around them. Therefore, their personalities are shaped and modified depending on the people living in their environments, it is undoubtedly possible for them to become an individual with incredible capabilities to lead everyone in the team to tremendous achievements if those people are able to find someone who aligns with their values and beliefs. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being an active role model prevents young demographics in society from following a scandal-ridden path. Negative role model only provides terrible experiences in their school curriculums which is highly severe to shape a useful personality trait. Behaviours like laziness, disrespect and aggressiveness will bring young children down the path of sins and crimes since they are unable to approach the proper education system. Hence, being a positive role model is not only a protection to help them avoid an unwanted future filled with illegal activities but also an opportunity to promote them develop themselves in life, become a leader who is willing to inspire everyone and have a career ladder to reach the peak of their improvements. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, being an active role model is invariably crucial and beneficial not only for themselves but also for a nation on a large scale. This process of modelling allows children to observe their thoughts and have opportunities for  positive reinforcement of learning behaviours."}

But others believe that teenagers should focus on the subject that they are good at or that thay find the most interesting. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.", "content": "Society is polarized into two groups almost equally that, whether all academic subjects should be taught in schools or, the choice should be given to opt for the subject of interest to adolescents . Although both notions appear to be rational, however, I opine with the former statement that students should learn different subjects due to the fact that it not only expand their horizon but also instils  creativity. In the following paragraphs, we will elaborate on both viewpoints and discuss why I am in favour of the traditional method of studying. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, the proponents of the former statement believe that, by studying all subjects, students are able to expand their horizons. In other words, they can explore their interests and diversify their skills and capabilities by engaging themselves in learning different types of studies. For instance, a student learning history and mathematics  is able to expand his knowledge in general, by knowing about  ancient times and, at the same time, applying basic statistical skills in real life while handling finance by learning mathematics. Moreover, in today's rapid job market, companies often hire candidates with multi-skillset. Thus, it is clear  why many are in favour of traditional methods of studying.\r\n\r\nAnother school of thought states that  teenagers should concentrate only on the subjects that they are passionate about and keen to learn. This is because of the fact that  there is no feeling of boredom and pressure to study the subjects that they are lacking interest in. Moreover, it is beneficial for their future career goals. For instance, a pupil, who wants to be a painter or a financial advisor, can begin learning the relevant subjects in advance which will be helpful in achieving their career goal. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, educational institutes should follow the traditional method of the school curriculum, that is, to focus on all subjects because youngsters are impulsive and have poor decision-making skills. Learning all subjects enables critical thinking and give them more opportunity to explore their interest of which they might be unaware . \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, although, focusing on the subject of one's choice, make  learning interesting and undoubtedly, helpful in achieving career-related goals, however, learning all subjects expands one's horizon and enables critical thinking and also diversifies their skillsets. I strongly opine that the former argument as the prons are indeed too great."}

Do you think it is a positive or negative development?", "content": "Advertising is the easiest and most usable way for corporations to promote their products. They can rely on celebrities, or set a positive image without any details of what they are selling. However, the most common way is to show a certain feature which they want to emphasize. In some businesses, there is a new trend to make ads focusing on the new aspects of their items. This might be the basic method to sell things they produce. This essay will explore the reason for this trend and the pros and cons also.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some people think that this trend would be a good chance to be informed about what is new in a certain market. For example, one of my colleagues bought a new cell phone right after she saw the advertisement. Since that advert pronounced the improved camera performance and at that time, she was looking for a resort which can alternate a telescope whenever she went to concerts. This could be a pro of this trend. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my view on this issue is quite opposite. Advertising usually convinces the community to buy something constantly. As a result, a lot of folks purchase something which are not really necessary. For instance, all society has cell phones so we don't need to purchase another one since they function well enough. However, brand-new aspects in ads always catch people's eyes and appeal consumers to pay for something unnecessary. This is the first and the worst cons. This atmosphere often leads to consumerism and it naturally gives rise to concerns about overused resources. I can take my experience as an example. I bought a new food container a few weeks ago through a SNS promotion. The advert showed the new function that could store vegetables for a longer time than the previous ones. People including me who purchased this commodity would think that it was a good way not to waste food. However, I started to purchase more foods because I had a belief that the containers would keep these foods well. In other words, I rather spent more compared to the past. This is the last cons of this trend. It could produce a tremendous trash problem.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, this trend would be useful for some people. However, it generally tends to cause consumerism, resource overuse, and pollution. For these reasons, emphasizing too much on new aspects would be a bad idea."}

Some homes can be hundreds of years old so the background can be quite relevant to some people. I will be discussing the reasons and how people can research their own home.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons would be to try and establish the true value of the property. Especially from an investment point of view. This is because knowing the value of a home can help potential buyers negotiate with the seller to get a better deal on their new home. For example, if a house was sold for a hundred thousand five years ago, they buyer now has a better idea of the true value. Additionally, it gives them some peace of mind as some homes can be quite expensive. Moreover, it gives them an idea of when they would need to renovate the property, as this is usually a requirement after a certain period of time for most houses and buildings.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways in which a person may be able to find out about the history of a particular building or house. The easiest would be to use the internet and find out as much as they can online. Not to mention, they would also be able to find out about the entire area or region, not only one specific building. Another way would be to ask the real estate agent what they know about the property as they tend to have the most knowledge about the properties they deal with. Lastly, contact their local library and try to find some historic books about the area.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, fraud is becoming a lot more common than people think. Therefore, it is no surprise people are more interested in their homes. As time goes on, it is important that the government regulates ways in which the history of each residential property is open to the public."}

Their aim is to get work and therefore, they keep on chasing  different operations. Additionally, these procedures are performed to enhance different facial features such as nose, lips, cheeks, and jawline. Moreover, Some of the methods are also designed to change the shape of the face and tighten the skin. In addition, there are various people who opt for  whitening procedures. Today, a lot of individuals are experiencing without doing proper research. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these people are unaware of the consequences that could cause damage to their health. There are side effects associated with each method. The outcomes sometimes may lead the person to receive a lifelong disability. It is never advised by any doctor to take a risk but in the current era, a major concern of  health professionals has also changed. Instead of looking for the betterment of people, they are running after money. Moreover, presently, there are a lot of cosmetic hospitals in different areas of the world. This is the duty of staff members  to guide the crowd and only perform the highly important ones such as a brunt face from acid could be cured. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, I would strongly disagree to go for cosmetic methods. There are exceptions in which the person has to go for such things but not for the sake of beautification, this is totally wrong. Each individual should keep in mind that once the process is done wrong, you can't go to the previous appearance."}

Therefore, many of them would suffer from the challenges of the lack of writing competence.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, indulging in computer and mobile phone chatting is time-consuming, which results in less time for reading. What is worse, daily communication on electronic gadgets is likely to exacerbate the development of short attention spans and gradually lead to a loss of interest in reading. Nowadays, it is not difficult to notice that there are not many youngsters who read for pleasure or have the habit of reading. Thus, their reading interest and competence will be degraded in the long term.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, there are websites and mobile applications that can improve the literacy skills of the young in a convenient way. For example, dictionary applications are particularly helpful to enlarging lexical resources; e-books can be appealing to young minds who are not attracted to print media. But unfortunately, the young generation now is more inclined to chat with others to expand their social circle than to develop linguistic ability.\r\n\r\nOverall, I believe that too much access to computers and mobile phones for the young generation to communicate with each other can indeed exert adverse effects on their capabilities in reading and writing."}

In this essay, I am going to discuss reasons behind this obstacle and how communities and authorities can tackle this issue. \r\n\r\nTo begin, with the avalibilty of various apps and online services has been encorging adolescents to creating easily zoom meeting. As a result, the Internet assists to erase the geographical bounderies and overcome on the costs of travelling fees. For example, students can meet their friend in video call via messanger or zoom from over the whole world. Furthermore, parents play a critical role in this problem as they give their children no time for themselves to go out and participate in outdoor activities by hardening them with a harch time-tight academic scheduale. In other words, teens spend most of their times contributing in many acadmies and competitions more than taking a break to explore their surrounding and make mamories with their mates.\r\n\r\nHowever, the government and communities, including parents, have a crucial role in handling and tightening spreading this sighnificant issue. firstly, authorities need to emply more obligations and restrictions according to age. For instance, applying high fees on the internet services in favour of limiting teenagers access will help to controlling on them as they cannot afford it. secondly, society should increase their awareness with downsides of over-interaction with their relationship online instead of real interactions such as isolation, depression, and health conditions. To illustrate, communities should provide activites, festivals, and public palces to encourging them to gather with their mates and families. Parents also should clear the aim of meeting people face-to-face as human being's relationships rely on body language, facial expresions, and intonation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,  despite the improvement of digital technology, it is undoubtedly that it has many downsides on teenagers lifestyle, so the community and government should handle these problem by applying a strict laws and increasing their knolwedge about dangers of misusing of the internet."}

That's why it's important for parents to monitor their screen time and limit the hours dedicated to video games,moreover,parents should encourage their children to go outside and play during their leisure time .\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, I believe that the advantage outweighs  the disadvantage,nowadays there is useful content on the t,v which could educate them,as for video games , multiple research has proved that playing video games help young children develop coordination skills.\r\n\r\nin conclusion, as opposed to the people who believe t.v and other sources of digital entertainment would result in a disadvantage to the growing population, I strongly believe spending time on video games and t,v can only benefit children when they grow up. It's the duty of the parents to make sure that their children's screentime are monitored,this way they can obtain skills and have a healthier lifestyle."}

Others argue that it is better to try and improve such situations.\r\n\r\nDisscuss both views and draw you opinion", "content": "The issue of accepting an awful situation instead of trying to tackle it has sparked heated controversy, with the opponents maintaining that if someone experiences a bad situation, it should remain unchanged, whilst the supporters claim that we should handle the issue and enhance it. Personally, i support the latter even though the former has some positive attributes.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is often argued that people who choose to stay in an unpleasant set of circumstances experience a continuous state of depression. Indeed, it is widely known that a bad situation causes unpleasant feelings in the person that experiences it. For instance, a recent study revealed that individuals that avoid getting away from their comfort zones and facing a problem are more prone to experience psychological problems.\r\n\r\nAnother point in support of my opinion is that a bad situation includes serious repercussions. Admittedly, when a human being is procrastinated and avoids tackling their difficulties is in a bad mood constitutionally and has mood swings during the day. Therefore, they become isolated and sometimes they commit suicide.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is claimed that individuals who choose to remain in a situation that is troublesome are afraid of losing their comfort zone and they live peacefully. Admittedly, it is difficult to get away from the ordinary in order to improve a situation. For example, the majority of people are not succeeding in their life be it in their personal life or career level for the reason that they are not fans of change. Yet this is not entirely true since every start is hard but if a person overcomes a problem automatically feels better than before.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, although it is effortless for society to choose the easy path and have a specific routine, I firmly believe that people should be open to challenges and face their problems , only then they do a positive step forward in mankind."}

If they are living away from their homes the process to get in touch with their loved ones was very complicated and time-consuming. This drawback of the olden days made a lot of communities suffer and left them to carry tough life.\r\n\r\nWhereas on another hand when the latest discoveries are available, it is very much convenient for family, friends, relatives and the known ones to interact with each other. It takes just a matter of seconds to contact a person staying overseas. The reach of technology is improving present day. If you want to send any message to more than one person, it is at your fingertips. Due to these inventions long distance relationships are possible. Studies and official meetings can be seen taking place remotely with the aid of these new ideas. \r\n\r\nHowever, some folk say that due to the availability of this easiness people are getting limited to the gadgets themselves.

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "Technology is progressing at an exponential pace and this makes it very difficult to predict what the schools and the teacher-taught relation of 2050 will be like. However, I do agree with the given statement that the typical teaching of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by 2050.\r\n\r\nEducation will be driven by technology and learning will be able to happen anytime and anywhere. Students will also be able to make choices in how they learn the content. Learning will be based on individual interests and need. It will no longer be the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach. Technology will serve as a means to the resources that students will be able to utilize in order to broaden their learning.\r\n\r\nTeachers will become facilitators of knowledge and no longer the only experts because of the rapid and constant changes and additions to information that can be found. For example, the amount of medical knowledge doubles every eight years; it is said that half of what an engineering student learns in their first year is obsolete or revised by the time they graduate. The teacher will still guide students through learning but it will be impossible for teachers to have all the knowledge with technology. That is capable of finding more than can be learned. The teacher will still be needed to help students learn where to locate information and help students evaluate sites and resources for validity.\r\n\r\nSpecialists in technology will need to be part of the educational environment to constantly enrich the learning environment for students. Each child will have a portable computer and textbooks will not exist. Teachers will use tablet PCs and projectors to call up images at the front of the classroom at the touch of a button. With the old sound of chalk on a blackboard being replaced by the hum of desktop computers.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I pen down saying that despite all the new technology in 2050. The school would still remain a social occasion and teachers would still be there even if their way of imparting knowledge would be driven by technology."}

The traditional classroom setting of a teacher instructing a group of students may be considered outdated by the year 2050. While I agree that the role of teachers and students in the classroom may change, I believe that the traditional teaching situation will still exist to some extent.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technology has already begun to revolutionize the way we learn. Online education, for example, has become increasingly popular and has allowed individuals to access educational resources from anywhere in the world. In addition, virtual classrooms and video conferencing have made it possible for students and teachers to connect and communicate without the need for a physical classroom. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has also impacted the way we learn. These technologies can personalize learning experiences for each individual, allowing students to work at their own pace and receive customized feedback. This has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods and create a more individualized approach to education.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not believe that the typical teaching situation will completely disappear. While technology has its benefits, there are certain aspects of learning that require face-to-face interaction. The physical presence of a teacher in the classroom can be invaluable, as it provides students with the opportunity to ask questions, receive immediate feedback, and engage in group discussions. The classroom environment also promotes socialization and collaboration, which are essential skills for students to develop. Moreover, the traditional teaching situation provides a sense of structure and routine that can be beneficial for students. The physical classroom creates a learning space where students can focus and eliminate distractions. It also establishes a routine for students, which can help them develop good study habits and time management skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the teaching situation in the year 2050 may be different from what we know today, I believe that the traditional classroom setting will still exist to some extent. While technology may transform the way we learn, the physical presence of a teacher and the classroom environment provide benefits that cannot be replaced by digital tools. Therefore, it is important to embrace technological advancements while also recognizing the value of traditional teaching methods."}

Computers make our life easier regardless of place. Technological improvements can vary in their benefits, and it is unavoidable that many workplaces, including government ,offices tend to use technology due to make their job easier and save their running costs. In 2002, the Azerbaijani government announced that all judgements should be passed by e-mail to the executive officers to accomplish.\u00a0If one of their employees is bad at technology, they can not handle some problems as well as they can not help to drive companies business successfully. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, computer skills will help children for getting a secure job. Many people in our country are not taking the artificial intelligence sector seriously, therefore, their children do not tend to insist on learning computer skills. Today, the demand for AI is increasing rapidly and many foreign companies are willing to pay high sums for these workers, thus children will be better off. In future, robots can replace us and captivate our place in work. In that case, children that are good at technology can get out of this situation and they, probably, find accurate jobs related to their computer skills. Otherwise they can be between jobs and have to cope with financial issues. In South Korea, about 15% of their accountants are robots and the number climb up day-by-day.\u00a0\r\n\r\nIn summary, while some argue that technological skills can be a huge burden for children, I consider that by getting knowledge of computers, children will have a more chance to be well off in future and they can maintain their careers hardly."}

While mobile phones offer numerous benefits that enhance convenience, several concerns associated with their usage can harm human health and well-being. However, despite these drawbacks, imagining a life with cell phones is easier. In this essay, I will go into detail about this development's advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of cell phones has revolutionized various aspects of life. Firstly, mobile phones provide a plethora of entertainment options. For example, playing video games has attracted many users worldwide, particularly among individuals aged 16 to 35. Additionally, mobile applications enable users to easily access their favourite music, movies, and series while offering customizable playlists. Moreover, cell phones have simplified daily routines by providing convenient solutions. Online shopping has become effortless, with deliveries made directly to desired destinations. Communication has also been greatly facilitated, allowing individuals to send messages and make calls from anywhere. Furthermore, location-finding applications make navigating to desired goals a breeze. However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential harms associated with improper and excessive cell phone usage.\r\n\r\nDespite the numerous advantages, integrating cell phones into daily life has specific challenges, as with any technological advancement. One of the critical concerns is the potential for time consumption and addiction, particularly among students who are easily enticed by the various attractions offered by mobile phones. Excessive usage can lead to poor concentration during studies and hinder educational progress. Additionally, unrestricted access to internet content through mobile phones can expose individuals to cultural dissonance. For instance, someone from a community where women are required to wear hijab may come across images that contradict their ethical values, leading to irritation and discomfort. However, these complications can be mitigated to some extent by implementing filters and careful observation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that cell phones have made life more enjoyable and convenient. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the social and behavioural issues that arise from their overuse.

Others deny that these factors have any significant influence on people\u2019s behaviour. What is your opinion?\r\n\r\nIn this era, the usage of video games on different types of play stations is increasing day by day. Children enjoy these modern sorts of games with full concentration. Many games are related to violence, like fighting with each other in groups. The effects of these types of games are too dangerous for society. However, fewer people think that these types of games do have not any major effects on an individual\u2019s behaviour. In the following paragraphs, I will explain the reasons and my opinion, about how these types of games destroy  children's lives in our society. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning, according to fewer people, children play different sorts of games in different ways. Few children prefer to play games on computers and mobile phones but others play on the latest play stations. Modern types of games based on  fighting themes like attacking and fighting with each other etc. PUBG game is the best example. In this game, a battlefield creates and 100 people are dropped on this battlefield, and they are in the form of groups and each group contain four members. They all fight with the help of different types of latest arms with each other. In 2020 a crime was reported in Lahore Pakistan, a boy killed her mother and sister with a gun same to this game theme. After investigating  this case, it was clear that the boy plays a lot of PUBG and now he was not mentally stable. The same scenario also happened  in New Zealand where a man killed many people in a mosque.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, other people say that these types of games do not create any bad impact on the life of an individual. Furthermore, these games increase the power of command and increase the decision power in the children. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the bad effects of these are overweight. Because many incidents have occurred owing to these types of violent games. However, there are just a few benefits of these games like increasing the decision power."}

Does this development bring more advantages or disadvantages to the environment", "content": "Urbanization has been accelerating in the past few decades, with increasing numbers of populations migrating from the countryside to the urban areas. However, this trend causes a series of problems that can not be ignored.\r\n\r\nTo provide sufficient housing for residents, parks and green lands are replaced by residential buildings. When the open spaces in the urban areas could be used up, a common practice is to reclaim more land from the suburban area, which is considered an unsustainable way. The reduction of greenery coverage and the damage to the ecological environment are unavoidable as the limited  resources cannot accommodate so many dwellers in metropolises.\r\n\r\nThe large number of urban populations is also responsible for various kinds of pollution. Air pollution has become a big concern that plagues inhabitants and the main source of air pollutants is the growing number of private cars. Moreover, in order to create more jobs to meet the demand for employment, many factories are built inside or around there, and they emit waste gas into the atmosphere, pollute the water and soil surrounding there and create a lot of noise with their machinery.\r\n\r\nSome may argue that with immigrants moving from the countryside to cities, the rural areas can benefit in terms of the environment. However, these benefits are not comparable to the problems faced in metropolises. The vast space of the countryside has an advantage in cleansing the pollutants, and the pollution generated by its sparse population is much less than that in the densely-populated cities.\r\n\r\nOverall, in the process of urbanization, many environmental issues may occur and need to be dealt with in a proper manner."}

In my opinion, this is the best thing to do as these only help to increases criminalality in the younger generation.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, shows made for TV and electronic games are made based on the popularity among the crowd. This is because the people used to vent their frustrations in their social life playing games and watching shows. Nowadays the games and shows become more violent as the discrimination in the society increases and most of them sees themselves in the characters in the shows and games and divert their anger to the other characters in these platforms which they cannot do in real life. For example in a survey conducted by an online platform states that 70% of the people likes to play a boxing video game to reduce their anger on their bosses. These scenario is dangerous as these these behaviours will eventually becomes a pattern in their real life.\r\n\r\nSecondly, these type of contents are dangerous for children as they might not understand how abnormal it is. As the children sees these kind of shows and games they might thing these are normal behaviours and will become part of their life without understanding the dangers of it. For instance a survey conducted by American Psychological Association among students points that the kids are more leaning towards games like Bulletstorm which are very violent in nature. Hence it would be very useful for parents if these violent products are banned on the government level.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, eventhough these shows and games are made as part of their popularity it could never deny the fact that it increases the criminality in the society and also increases the chance that the future generation might behave as in the characters of these shows and games as it is normal."}

There are extremely number of people who are elder siblings. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being an elder sibling.\r\n\r\nThere are a few advantages of being an elder sibling. One obvious benefit of it is that elder siblings are usually matured. In other words, when an individual is an elder sibling, it means that he experienced a lot, he had more  vital situations than his brothers and sisters. Therefore, younger siblings always can ask for an advice and help. Elder siblings always help because of their maturity. Another evident merit of it is that elder siblings are given a big attention  by their parents. It can be noted that elder children are parent\u2019s first children. Moreover, parents extremely wait for their first children. As a consequence, elder children get a lot of care. Hence, being matured and getting a lot of attention are the two main benefits of being an elder sibling. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are some disadvantages of being an elder sibling. Firstly, elder siblings always should  solve problems. When he or she is elder sibling, they always have to solve various questions and troubles. For instance, they might solve not only daily life questions, but also tackle a different tasks such as earning money, looking for little siblings. Secondly, elder siblings are expected many success by their parents. As elder children are first children, parents always wait for extremely amount of achievements while younger children aren\u2019t requested so by parents. When this happens so often, it get elder siblings   annoyed.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are obvious advantages and disadvantages of being an elder sibling. In my opinion, being an elder sibling is cool, but sometimes it has own minuses."}

Others feel they are an opportunity for businesses.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both sides and give your own opinion.", "content": "Nowadays, the change of world temperature is a controversial issue. While it is believed that many businesses could be destroyed by fixing global warming, I side with those who feel that solving this problem is a chance for many businesses. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is argued that addressing the climate change could make some people unemployed. Those in favour of this idea state that one of the main sources of global warming is big factories using fossil as a source of energy to make their products. For example, everyday tons of gasoline is consumed in the building industry to produce bricks. As a result, by banning the use of this kind of fuel, a large number of factories could be closed, and many people working in this field have to look for a new job. Moreover, they claim that many car drivers could lose their jobs since old cars have an important role in air pollution and increasing dioxide carbon into the atmosphere. Thus, scrapping old cars could incur not only some low income drivers, but also could disrupt people\u2019s transportation. \r\n\r\nHowever, efforts to tackle the climate change obstacles has capability to flourish many businesses. New sources of energy which are considered safe for the environment will be more popular, and by increasing the demands, the suppliers have to expand their businesses to provide the need of the society. For instance, many new power plants might be built which work with renewable energy, such as wind. In fact, many people can get a job in this new development. Furthermore, climate change reforms could have a positive effect on the car industry. Car companies could use a new technology to make electric cars which are more efficient and less pollutant for the environment. Since people try to have a role in improving environmental issues, they are more interested in buying electric cars which leads to more success for this business. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although climate change reforms might shut down some old building industries or car companies, it could succeed businesses using renewable and electric energy. Therefore, on balance, I believe reforms resulted from climate change efforts have positive impacts on businesses."}

As a result, some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from the school syllabus so that children can concentrate on academic work.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "The issue of reforming school curriculum in the educational system by dropping courses that are not concluded in STEM ( science, technology , engineering, maths) has sparked heated controversy, with the supporters maintaining that school juveniles should not be pressed by non-academic subjects and focus on crucial courses such as chemistry  , whilst the opponents claim that physical education, music and art play a vital role in the student's life. Personally, I support the latter opinion even though the former has some positive attributes.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is often argued that the younger experience a hectic schedule in the school curriculum and need to be refreshed and alleviate stress in order to continue giving their best and they can achieve it only by participating in art subjects such as physical education. Indeed, it is vital important students exercise and get away from reality for a while otherwise they will drive crazy and their performance will be submerged. It is clearly illustrated by recent scientific research which output that students who are not participating in non-academic courses tend to not pass with flying colours onaverage than those who play an instrument or volleyball. \r\n\r\nAnother point in support of my opinion is that even though the majority of children pursue a career in science there are also students who have an innate talent in music or art. In particular, being talented in playing guitar cannot be replaced by an academic subject such as maths or chemistry. Therefore, it is fair for them to have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and goals independently be it in academic or non-academic subjects.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is claimed that not only juveniles do not hit the books but also are exhausted after attending extracurricular activities. Admittedly, students have the tendency to overindulge once they participate in cookery, drawing. For instance, the aforementioned activities are challenging for them and according to a school's data in the North America students are less effective and are bored in STEM after their participation in non-academic subjects. Yet, this is not entirely true since children have a lot of energy and they can be bookworms as well as attending art or music classes simultaneously,\r\n\r\nAll things considered, although students can't concentrate totally after attending non-academic courses. I firmly believe that undergraduates are able to do both academic and non-academic subjects and it is crucial either include to the syllabus. Only then do students strike a balance in their hectic lifestyle and continue to enhance their skills spontaneously."}

Some people think that this is  good for a country., while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and giye your opinion.", "content": "People hold distinctive opinions regarding a debate which is linked to whether people should earn high salaries or not. Some people assert that high salaries are beneficial for a country, while others claim that authorities should take some measures in terms of earnings. In my opinion, both sides have plausible arguments, which should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe major reason why people are in favour of earning high salaries is advantageous is that globalization is increasing sharply every passing day.  With the ever-rising globalization, undeveloped and developing countries have to pay great salaries to qualified citizens living in these countries. People who are experts in their fields want to make great salaries; however, if they cannot earn high wages, they regard brain drain as inevitable. For instance, in Turkey, a great number of doctors immigrated to German because  the government did not meet their needs. In the light of this reality, many people living in Turkey faced deteriorated and insufficient health services.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the argument clarified above, there is also a significant argument by the opponents who believe that governments should check wages and people should make money equally. It is possible to associate earning too high salaries with a variety of negative effects, one of which is lower education quality. When people earn high salaries, authorities have to allocate a huge part of the government budget for high salaries. Although education is the most important thing, today, many teenagers cannot go to school owing to huge school fees. Therefore, governments should allocate enough funds for education facilities instead of high wages.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, having elucidated both perspectives, I think it can be concluded that ignoring the vital points claimed by any of the two sides above would result in undesirable circumstances"}

Do you agree or disagree?", "content": "It is a belief to many that entertainment in the form of video games and social media is harmful to society and individuals. The reasons regarding this bold accusation are numerous, some of which are health-related. Society grows devoid of communities/friendships, and is rather made up of antisocial introverts with next to zero communication skills. I profoundly understand and agree with this statement, thus the following paragraphs will deeply explore it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is not far-fetched at all that social media detaches humans from reality. Scrolling for hours on end is everything but natural. Thereafter, the attention span is affected negatively, causing students difficulty when focusing on any given topic. Be that as it may, some cases are fine, one of which is spending quality time with your family by watching a film. Nonetheless, that does not excuse the overuse of electronics. E-games are known to be overstimulating, eventually making it hard for users to fulfill daily tasks in life due to their \u201cboring nature\u201d. What is more, is that dopamine is released in such immense quantities that actual beneficial activities such as reading books or playing sports grow underwhelming. On top of that, obesity is a likely destination for all couch potatoes that struggle to leave their rooms and touch grass, other than the fact that their friendships will gradually deteriorate.\r\n\r\nIn spite of being aware of the side effects of using portable devices 24/7, people are rendered addicted to tapping on their screens endlessly. Subsequently, many health issues, whether mental or physical, are invited. As previously stated, becoming overweight is a likely risk. Moreover, eye strain is caused slowly but surely, especially to those already suffering vision issues. Not to mention, depression has already affected most teenagers of our generation for this particular reason. Young adults nowadays spend most of their time straddling their phones, whereas the past generations lived life the right way with their friends and families. All motivation drops once a human is held captive by a metal object, which does nothing but waste time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are specific scenarios when switching on your phone is acceptable and harmless. However, 95% of the time it sucks the life out of humanity until we have no energy anymore. Therefore, my unwavering opinion is that limiting our screen time to a minimum is the best, as social media and video games are a waste of time."}

I will be discussing on both ways that can aid a child\u2019s development.\r\n\r\nFirstly, homeschooling can save the time of travel and cost and the funds allocated for the child can be maximized by taking up his or favourite past time or hobby. More time can be  spent by each child at home and this can help the child to focus on weaker subjects. For instance, my cousin was homeschooled till 16 years old and she had ample time to have full concentration on all the academic subjects and scored well in college when she pursue higher education.          \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s beneficial for students to attend school and gain a holistic learning experience. The students get chance to speak and interact with other classmates and they can have better soft skills in future. For example, Singapore\u2019s high school students gain opportunities to work in a team and learn from one another for projects and presentations. This will inculcate interest to learn and deepen their understanding of the subjects that they pursue.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that both methods of educating a child are important in their own aspect. A safe and conducive environment and a school will help to guide a child and develop his or her path to success and build a good future."}

This is due the fact that there are no body language and emotions. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would like to argue the benefits of interact among people via social media significantly more than drawbacks. The first advantage of social media it provide healthy environment for interaction among many individuals. To illustrates, people do not need to stay in the same place with others in order to communicate, which means people can avoid spread diseases. For example, when the Covid-19 pandemic started the governments around the world recommend their people to avoid face-to-face interaction in order to protect people from get this virus. Convenience is another benefit of employ social media to interact among people instead of face-to-face. This is because people can stay in touch with loved ones from their comfort their home rather than meet other people on the caf\u00e9 or restaurant. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, although the social media can bring downsides including, make people feel isolated, I still believe the upsides of interaction via social media outweigh the downsides because social media offer healthy and convenient way  to interaction among people."}

And these containers are brought to recycling factories, where the process of waste recovery begins. Secondly, all amassed jars are cleaned and sorted out in order to get rid of waste. Then, the products go through specialized machines which shred them into tiny pieces. In the next step, the pieces are compressed to form a metal block. \r\n\r\nNext, the blocks are put into giant ovens that heat them under particular degrees for melting. After being softened, the aluminium is passed between two big rollers that flatten it from 2.5 mm to 6 mm thick, according to its application. Finally, flattened metal is delivered to special factories that produce drinking products, where canisters are filled with drinks and distributed to shops and local markets for consumers. In the UK 74% of distributed aluminium jars are reused."}

What are the reasons? Is this a negative or a positive trend?", "content": "It is a well-documented fact that people tend to opt for having babies later in their life nowadays. This essay will analyze what the possible causes of the aforementioned trend are before explaining why the merits of giving birth late are outweighed by its drawbacks.\r\n\r\nThere have been plenty of reasons for people to choose delayed parenthood. However, I suppose that the two following reasons are the most fundamental. First and foremost, parents would like to have stable finances before welcoming new members to their families. Obviously, in order to have a proper child\u2019s nourishment, many kinds of expenditures are required, such as food and drinks, clothes AND diapers. Therefore, it is essential that parents have a job with ADEQUATE income to afford the expenses needed to bring up a child. Another noteworthy point is the problem of parental skills. Besides having a considerable amount of money, should parents wish for the best development of the babies, time is asked for them to grow maturely enough to be exemplary teachers for their offspring. \r\n\r\nTwo sides of the trend should be thoroughly discussed before concluding whether it is a blessing. On the one hand, it is understandable why people state that delayed parenthood brings more advantages. The key rationale is mature parents can warrant qualities in children\u2019s characteristics, which deserves to be put in priority. Only when parents have experienced life's ups and downs are they likely to offer their babies the greatest advice within their possibility. On the other hand, there are also a number of downsides. First of all, the more the women grow old, the weaker they will be in reproduction. Hence, aged mothers may be at stake of suffering from fatal consequences coming from giving birth like excessive bleeding or miscarriage. Furthermore, a big generation gap could occur. Accompanied with skillfully tutoring a child, old parents probably have to deal with differences in mindsets which parallelly cause obstacles for them to sympathize with their beloved offspring. Generally, full-grown parents are good, nevertheless, the problems of the mothers\u2019 health and generation gap ought to be put in priority.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that people would like to have children late is mainly because of financial issues and parental skills and the positive repercussions associated with maturity ARE eclipsed by problems related to maternity\u2019s health and generation gap."}

What are the possible causes for rapid change, and what suggestions could be given for preparing people?", "content": "The current temp of living, changing different spheres and developing our society can dramatically illustrate that the conditions in which we function also are reinventing. So, both employee's and employer's work world isn't an exception: the high level of staff turnover and multitasking can be overwhelming and confusing, undermining people's and company's efficiency. But, fortunately, if there is a problem, there always exist some causes and, as a result, possible solutions.\r\n\r\nIt's often said that an unfavourable working environment (including rapid changes) can be a consequence of an unreasonable approach to create working areas and the wrong building of connections between workers at different levels of the hierarchy. Additionally, the lack of knowledge and absence of flexibility among employers can be one of the main reasons. And, finally, the \"puzzled position\" of business leaders and their misunderstandings of the value of long-term workers can be fatal conditions, which can lead to a negative atmosphere in the labour market.\r\n\r\nWe could solve the problem by maintaining an environment  which could help (workers) to keep the same jobs and offer much more suitable and comfortable working conditions. Also, I think it's a good idea to invest in mid-term and long-term employers by giving them opportunities to learn something new and expand the knowledge of their fields. Besides, workers and job-seekers also should realise that partly it's their responsibility to resist stress and be able to face absolutely new perspectives.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it must be said that our world rebuilding and changes in the work area are inevitable, so it's necessary to see the whole situation and conditions of existing realistically."}

To what extent you agree or disagree?", "content": "In the modern era of technology and online connectivity, a host of people argue that traditional schools are now superfluous given the abundance of information and learning resources available on the Internet. From my perspective, while Internet-based education has some remarkable advantages, traditional schooling is of paramount importance for the comprehensive development of children.\r\n\r\n  To begin with, the digital revolution has offered unprecedented access to a vast array of information and therefore radically reformed traditional teaching methods and approaches. Students, irrespective of their geological location, are now able to watch lectures delivered at reputable academies as well as study scientific research in a variety of fields on the Internet, which would not be otherwise available in traditional classes. Thus, a plethora of information is likely to foster not only students' independent learning but also their intellectual curiosity. Furthermore, these active learners can learn at their own pace and level with a view to optimising their learning outcomes.  \r\n\r\n  On the other hand, it is indisputable that traditional schooling has multifaceted benefits which go beyond the delivery of academic content. Firstly, it creates an academic atmosphere with both dynamic interaction and healthy competition between students. By conferring with their partners, each student has the propensity for pursuing a \"debate culture\", which is the key element in cultivating an immense sense of industry and competitiveness among them.For this reason, traditional classes act as a driving force in improving learners' interpersonal skills and peer support for mutual development. Meanwhile, instructors also play an important role to interpret abstract concepts into straightforward ones, helping students have thorough insights into lessons and accumulating a broad educational background.\r\n\r\n  In conclusion, although the adoption of technology has been a crucial breakthrough , I have a staunch belief that schools are essential for children's development."}

This essay will explore both positive and negative effects on individuals.\r\n\r\nLiving a solitary life, on the one hand, could be disadvantageous, for various reasons related to loneliness and difficulties when they change their mind. The solo dwellers might feel lonely or even  isolated in some emotionally vulnerable moments while there is no one around, it becomes a struggle for them to unburden themselves. This circumstance exacerbates  people who live solitarily, causing them to suffer from mental and emotional issues which leads directly to an unhealthy mental life. In addition, the further explanation for this sensation is the negative feelings during festive seasons. When solo dwellers glimpse happy couples and joyful families. Alongside this, the decision to live alone could be temporary. Therefore, once they want to change in order to start a family, this intention might be far from a straightforward task.\r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned downsides, this way of living could have its own merits, chief among which are a sense of freedom and self-improvement. People who choose to live alone will have some leeway to enjoy the independence of life without considering worrying about others' opinions or criticisms from co-living partners. For instance, solo dwellers can refurbish their nest or throw away a late-night party in the absence of their parent's preferences and limitations. Additionally,  solo living is said to be the most advantageous lifestyle that makes it easier for people to enhance their career. They will have chances to take advantage of their alone time and space to develop their personal skills, for example, financial management, repair skill, cooking, etc... as well as nurture their individual interest. If they settle for a co-living way of life which means living with their parents or spouses, they tend to count on the others.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I contend that the desirable experience of solo living could have both favourable impacts from an individual perspective."}
