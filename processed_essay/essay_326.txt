Revised:

In our modern era, it is believed that an increasing number of people are suffering from health problems caused by our sedentary lifestyle, which cannot be effectively treated with modern medicines. Some people argue that we should promote the use of traditional medicines to address these health issues. This essay agrees with the statement to a certain extent, and will provide two reasons to support this position.

To begin with, traditional medicine has shown surprising effectiveness in treating certain diseases that modern medicine cannot cure. In other words, there are instances where traditional medicine has successfully eradicated diseases that have stumped modern medicine. For example, there was a man who was diagnosed with a lung disease and was given a prognosis of only four months to live. Determined to fight for his life, he decided to explore alternative treatments, such as Kazakh national medicine, which involves drinking kumis (a fermented dairy product) and spending time in the steppe. Astonishingly, when he returned to the hospital, his doctors acknowledged that his disease had somehow been cured. This example illustrates that alternative medicine can provide a viable solution in situations where modern medicine falls short.

Secondly, alternative medicine is generally considered to have fewer adverse effects on the human body. Most traditional medicines are derived from natural sources, such as plants, and therefore are less likely to cause harmful side effects. However, it is worth noting that certain forms of alternative medicine, like Chinese traditional medicine that involves the use of acupuncture needles, may carry some risks. On the contrary, modern medicines can sometimes worsen a patient's health condition if used improperly.

In conclusion, traditional medicine has the potential to treat health issues that modern medicine cannot effectively address. Additionally, alternative medicine generally offers benefits to the human body and is less likely to cause adverse effects. However, it is important to remember that modern medicine also plays a vital role in treating various diseases and should not be completely disregarded.
