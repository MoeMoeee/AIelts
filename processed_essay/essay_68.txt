Essay:

"Language is key to communicating with other people, and some people believe language is a big problem for someone who lives in a country where they need to speak a foreign language, and this problem leads to crucial issues such as social and practical. This essay will examine why I agree with this statement.

To begin with, living abroad is a dream for some people. Most of them want to have a better life and a better neighbourhood. The essential thing that people need to prepare is the language of the country they want to go to. Moreover, someone needs to know how to make conversation, not a short one but the complex one, because this is important to be accepted in new places or to find a job. For example, someone who chooses the UK to start a new life but does not know English will find a problem because they can not communicate with their coworkers or boss, leading to low performance in the workplace. As a result, it is not good for a new start.

Furthermore, this is happening for more than just social but for practical problems as well. A new place means new rules. People need to know about the new place they want to live. For instance, if someone from another country decides to live in Indonesia, all signs on the roads, restaurant menus, and the local people use the Indonesian language. It will be hard for someone who does not know Indonesia to want to live here. This will challenge those who want to live in another country.

To conclude, I strongly agree that language is essential to connect people. This skill will bring many opportunities if we are good at using it in the right place. Otherwise, a lack of ability to use a particular language brings drawbacks."


Revised:

Language is crucial for communication, and it is believed that living in a foreign country where one has to speak the local language can lead to serious social and practical problems. In my opinion, I agree with this statement as language is fundamental to fitting into a new community and adapting to a new culture.

Firstly, many people dream of living abroad for a better life, but not knowing the local language can make it challenging to communicate and build relationships with the local people. This can lead to social isolation, which can be detrimental to one's mental health. In addition, not being able to communicate well at work due to a lack of language skills can lead to poor performance and job dissatisfaction, ultimately affecting one's career prospects.

Secondly, not knowing the local language can create practical problems, such as understanding local customs and laws and navigating daily life activities. For example, if someone moves to a country where the road signs, restaurant menus, and other essential items are written in a foreign language, it can create significant difficulties for them. This can cause confusion and make it hard to adapt to a new environment.

In conclusion, language is a critical factor when it comes to living in a foreign country. It is essential to learn the language of the country to fit into the community and overcome practical challenges. Failure to adapt to the language can lead to social isolation, poor communication, and a reduced quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to invest time and effort in learning the local language to make the most of the opportunities that living in a new country can offer.
