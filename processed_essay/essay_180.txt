Revised:

Here is the edited essay with an IELTS structure:

It is commonly believed that moving large companies and factories, along with their employees, to the countryside could provide a solution to traffic congestion and housing shortages in major cities. While there are those who protest the relocation of such companies, I strongly agree that this could be an effective strategy. This essay will address the following reasons for my opinion.

Firstly, transferring sizable corporations and their workers to rural areas could alleviate current traffic overload. Large-scale businesses have numerous employees who often contribute to traffic congestion, particularly during rush hour. Thus, relocating these companies and workers outside of urban areas could reduce traffic congestion. Furthermore, transportation emissions from commuters and workers play a significant role in environmental pollution. By moving these companies and factories to suburban areas, the number of vehicles on urban roads would decrease, leading to a reduction in air pollution.

Additionally, transferring companies and factories to rural areas could address the housing supply issues in cities. Recent surveys indicate that workers often prefer accommodation located close to their place of employment. This preference for urban accommodation has led to increased housing demand and living costs in cities. Therefore, shifting housing demand to rural areas would put less pressure on the urban housing supply systems, leading to a reduction in housing prices and costs for urban dwellers.

In conclusion, relocating companies and their employees to suburban areas could help address traffic congestion and housing shortages in major cities. I am confident that this approach would lead to an effective solution to these problems.

Coherence and Cohesion:

Trong bài viết, bạn đã sắp xếp các ý rõ ràng và liên kết chúng một cách hợp lý. Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn một vài vấn đề cần cải thiện trong Coherence and Cohesion.

Ví dụ đầu tiên là trong đoạn thứ nhất, câu "It is common belief that there are those who protest relocation of big-size companies, factories as well as their staffs to rural areas" cần phải được kết nối với câu tiếp theo để giải thích tại sao có những người phản đối. Có thể sửa thành "However, some people argue that relocating big-size companies, factories, and their staffs to rural areas is not a feasible solution due to some reasons".

Ví dụ thứ hai, trong đoạn thứ hai, câu "According to the recent survey, that workers have the propensity for opting for their accommodation near their works" nên được kết nối với câu trước bằng cách sử dụng một từ nối nhẹ nhàng như "Moreover" để việc chuyển ý trở nên mượt mà hơn.

Bên cạnh đó, bạn cũng sử dụng các từ nối phù hợp và hợp lý như "To commence with", "On top of that", "In conclusion" để kết nối các ý trong bài viết. Tuy nhiên, cần lưu ý các từ này không nên lạm dụng, vì sử dụng quá nhiều sẽ làm bài viết trở nên đơn điệu.
