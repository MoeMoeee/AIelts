Essay:

"It is argued that saving is more vital than spending in our nowadays world. According to many opinions, in different aspects, expenditure brings people more benefits than saving does. In my point of view, I completely agree with that opinion and I will discuss 2 main reasons to prove my agreement.

In the first place, spending money can meet our subsistence needs. We can buy things that serve and improve our daily life. Such as purchasing a house to live, a motorbike or a car for traveling, or maybe a smartphone which is so necessary in our modern life. In addition, the acquisition of food, drinks and clothes everyday is also so important, especially to women, the one that takes care of people in a family. Moreover, monthly services’ bills such as water, electricity and Internet are needed to be paid.

As a result, being the second reason, spending can satisfy people's metal and material needs. As a consequence, that can bring us more content. We can buy whatever we want whenever we need. That is nothing but a sense of freedom and happiness. For example, when you go shopping or traveling, you can not deny that the sense of feeling afraid to see price when you buy things or souvenirs is so annoying. Furthermore, when you make a purchase of  a shirt, a toy that you like, a movie or music concert ticket,etc, you are happy. Being able to afford all daily needs somehow can make you proud of yourself and bring you a sense of confidence in life. And then your parents, your friends will be proud of you too. It all combined together creates a positive energy, a motivation for us to work harder and make more money to meet that feeling again.

In conclusion, it seems to me that spending money will improve our material and mental life."
