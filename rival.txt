Lexical & Grammatical errors

Errors in the essay:  
1. "people to choose" - Incorrect word choice. It should be "people choose". 
2. "much more important" - Redundant use of words. It can be simplified as "more important". 
3. "partially agree with the given notion" - Informal lexical item that is not allowed in academic writing. It can be rewritten as "I partly agree with the statement". 
4. "Apparently, No one can deny" - Inconsistent capitalization and incorrect punctuation usage. 
5. "A huge section of the population considered high-income a priority." - Subject-verb agreement problem. It should be written as "...considers high income a priority." 
6. "...make them able to sustain a lavish lifestyle." - Unnatural vocabulary usage. 7. "...opt for enjoyment or other non-financial factors.they might find it difficult..." - Missing space after period and incorrect sentence structure. 
8. "...designating a career path that they love," – Incorrect verb tense usage, it should be “designate” instead of “designating”. 
9. "...enough funds to live comfortably and raise a family." – Unnatural vocabulary usage, it could have been rephrased as “… enough financial resources…” 
10.“On the destructive part,” – Incorrect phraseology; this phrase does not make sense here. 
11.“personal relationships and the working environment are extremely vital for individuals.” – The subject-verb agreement is wrong; it should read: “Personal relationships and working environments are extremely vital for individuals.” 
12.“Having a supportive employer,” – This fragmentary sentence lacks context; there needs to be an independent clause attached before or after this phrase so that its meaning becomes clear within its context. 
13.“It is often observed that a person with work exhilaration” – Wrong collocation used here; ‘work exhilaration’ doesn’t exist in English. It should be “job satisfaction” instead. 
14.“many societies' feeling of vindication is associated with personal attainment.” – Incorrect use of apostrophe; it should read: “Many societies feel a sense of vindication…”

Task Response (TR)
Based on the given essay, I would rate it as a Band 7.0 in Task Response.  

The essay addresses all aspects of the task and presents a clear position with relevant ideas. The writer argues that both big salaries and job satisfaction are important for individuals to consider when choosing their profession. However, some parts of the essay lack comprehensive development, which slightly hampers the overall logic and development of the essay.  

For instance, while discussing why people prioritize high-income jobs over job satisfaction, the writer mentions artists and musicians who choose careers they love but may not provide enough funds to live comfortably. However, this point lacks sufficient supporting details or examples to make it more convincing.  

On the other hand, when discussing why job contentedness is essential for individuals' performance at work, the writer provides compelling evidence such as having supportive employers or friendly colleagues can impact an employee's performance positively. 

Overall, while there are some areas where further elaboration could have been provided to strengthen arguments better; however,the writer has presented a well-developed response that addresses all parts of the task with relevant ideas supported by appropriate evidence.

Coherence & Cohesion (CC): 7.0

Based on the Coherence and Cohesion band descriptors, this essay would receive a Band 7.0.  The writer demonstrates logical organization of information and ideas, ensuring a clear progression throughout the essay. Each paragraph presents a clear central topic. However, there are instances of underuse or overuse of cohesive devices which could have been used more effectively to connect ideas seamlessly without drawing attention to their use.  

For example, in the second paragraph, while discussing why people prioritize high-income jobs, the writer uses "therefore" to connect it with basic needs but fails to provide any further explanation or elaboration on how these two concepts are related. Similarly, in the third paragraph when discussing job contentedness as important as salary earned from work, there is no transition word used between sentences which makes it difficult for readers to understand how they are connected.  

Overall though, the essay has appropriate structure and well-managed paragraphing that facilitates smooth progression of ideas allowing readers to effortlessly follow its flow.


Lexical Resource (LR): 7.0

Based on the vocabulary used in the essay, it would receive a band score of 7.0 for Lexical Resource (LR). The writer employs a sufficient range of vocabulary that allows for some flexibility and precision. Less common lexical items related to the topic are used, demonstrating an awareness of style and collocation. However, occasional errors in word choice, spelling, and/or word formation may arise (approximately 5 errors or unnatural word choices).  

The essay uses a variety of words related to the topic such as “lavish lifestyle”, “work exhilaration” and “personal attainment”. Additionally, academic phrases like “opt for enjoyment” and “designating a career path” have been incorporated skillfully. 

However, there are instances where incorrect words have been used which could affect communication. For example: "On the destructive part" instead of "On the contrary". Also, there is repetition in using certain phrases like "huge section" twice within two sentences.  

Overall, while there is diversity in vocabulary usage throughout most parts of the essay with good control over collocations and academic phrases; however occasional inaccuracies do occur which prevent it from achieving higher band scores.


Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA): 7.0

Based on the essay provided, I would give it a GRA band score of 7.0.  

The writer has demonstrated the use of complex structures such as conditionals and relative clauses throughout the essay. The majority of sentences are error-free, but there are some instances where grammatical features may appear forced or incorrect. There may also be a few errors in punctuation.  

Overall, the grammar used in this essay is diverse and accurate enough to convey its intended message effectively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of naturalness and accuracy in some areas.
