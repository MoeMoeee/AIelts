Do you think it is a positive or negative development?", "content": "In today's modern world, major companies use adverts to promote their products in a new way. In my opinion, I consider that design and slogans play a major role to attract many consumers and they have a positive impact on the profit of enterprises.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that some businesses work so hard to promote their products or services to a large number of customers in a new method in order to increase their profits. In other words, the main purpose of companies is soaring their sales by promoting their products with a unique design that includes a specific colour in order to attract more customers. They prefer to see something stylish since some aspects of modern life are tedious. The sales consequently will increase gradually.\r\n\r\nAnother compelling reason why some businesses choose to advertise their services with a new strategy is that they focus more on a large number of people as soon as to buy their products than others for the same purposes. That is to say, nowadays, major companies offer many employment prospects in the marketing field as soon as to come up with subtle slogans that can attract consumers to purchase their products. They choose a slogan that is  amazing and it attracts the attention of consumers everywhere and anytime. For example, a taxi driver can be attracted by a nice and simple slogan even if he does not see the adverts of the product on television or on social media.\r\n\r\nFinally, in my view, I think that individuals support companies that advertise their products in a new and attractive approach. When enterprises do a lot of efforts to reach the majority of the community, they will encourage and impulse people to buy their products significantly. Using new formats to promote products as a result brings more financial outcomes for companies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, offering their products in a new way by altering their designs and slogans are definitely advantageous for the purpose of lifting up the profit of the companies and attracting many customers. Businesses should work on the design and slogan of their products because consumers appreciate  creativity."}

However easy access has made analytical minds disappear although it also helps make tasks easier. I will elaborate on this in forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many drawbacks to the Internet. People who use the internet are becoming dependent upon it. There are many platforms where solutions could be found for almost any situation. What one needs to do is just put some keywords and information would appear on the screen. So commuters do not need to make any research they can just copy the answer and paste it anywhere. For instance, chat GPT is an online platform which can leave many workers jobless in the future as teachers are being replaced by the internet.\r\n\r\nMoving to the benefits of the internet, it has made life easier. Information about almost everything is available just a click away. No one needs to study for hours to get to the conclusion. There are simple ways to solve problems, so no need to go to the traditional routes or formulae. For example, tasks could be done just by putting the equation and the answer will be there just in seconds or less, if asked what is pie, the web will show results and tell the source behind it.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are indeed detrimental to almost everything.

Some people think that it causes big problems. Others, however, think the ageing population has many advantages for business, government and for society in general. Discuss both views & give your own opinion", "content": "Due to the consecutive development of the standard of living, an average person\u2019s lifespan is lengthened. However, it has led to the state of an ageing population which is considered either to cause issues for authorities or to benefit the society. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of having an ageing citizen and through this essay, I will analyse the reasons for this assertion.  \r\n\r\nTo begin with, a shortage in the young label force could be seen as one of the gravest drawbacks to a country owning an ageing community. The dramatic decrease in the number of young dwellers has resulted in a reduction in the total of newborn babies per year. Alongside that, the elderly tend to avoid giving birth to an infant because their body can not accommodate the conditions of bearing a foetus. Therefore, there will be fewer options for the recruitment agency. Following that, the deficiency of new workers will deteriorate the country\u2019s economy. As industries require many employees with youthful strength and commitment to serve the needs of humanity. For instance, the service industry demands an immense volume of workers to operate.\r\n\r\nBesides, the ageing population also pressurises the economy with a tremendous amount of retirement pensions. As mentioned above, there are not enough staff which means that there will be no profits for the country\u2019s income. The potential of a country is evaluated through their workforce and economic sustainability. Not only in a shortage of money and being unable to pay for the social welfare but the nation also can not call for foreign investments. Therefore, the opportunities for country innovation in every area will decline without the help of other nations.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I believe that the drawbacks of an ageing population surpass the advantages of the effect of the old-aged workforce and the burden on the country\u2019s economy."}

Is this a positive or negative development?", "content": "Nowadays, in many societies, the youth have access to more freedom compared to the past. Whilst there are some drawbacks associated with this availability, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the primary advantage of having more freedom is that giving permission utilizing up-to-the-minute gadgets leads to the privilege of having access to higher education sources and reinforcing their knowledge. In addition, having access to technology not only provides teenagers with a wide range of information to enhance their knowledge but also plays an important role in order to find their passion for a specific subject which can be their future job. For example, some channels on YouTube can be highly beneficial for children to learn more about a particular subject which used to be unavailable. A further benefit of freedom is that the youngsters have the opportunity to express their opinions which brings about a greater development in their personalities and more self-confidence as well. For instance, children who have been asked about their ideas feel more invaluable and have a chance to accelerate their maturity process.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, giving freedom excessively can give rise to facing major problems. One disadvantage of freedom is that youngsters are more likely to be threatened by consuming cigarettes or other harmful drugs. Therefore, parents should allocate their children and raise their awareness about the detrimental effects of these behaviours. Another negative point of giving freedom is that teenagers can be prone to some dangerous tasks which can bring about vital issues. For example, being allowed to drive under the legal age may be prone for society.\r\n\r\nOn balance, it is true that giving freedom would seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive influences in terms of access to greater education and boosting their self-confidence outweigh the disadvantages."}

Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?", "content": "In today\u2019s world, the use of smartphones is very common, particularly among the young generation. Spending many hours on mobile phones has become a daily routine for some children. In my view, this is concerning and can be deemed a negative development due to the lack of creativity and potential hindrance in brain development. This essay will explore the reasons behind this case.\r\n\r\nNowadays, smartphones play an important role in people's lives. They serve not only as tools of communication but also as channels for online exploration. The perspectives on using phones freely vary depending on families and situations. Some parents might give permission to their kids for study purposes only because they could use the internet to find unlimited knowledge regardless of going to school. Others may allow phone usage for entertainment, such as watching cartoons on Youtube, as they believe it helps with relaxation.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks associated with uncontrolled phone usage. One significant issue is that when children spend more time on phones than going out to play with friends, they may lose social skills, which can lead to problems in their adulthood. Another adverse effect is that excessive phone use might cause health problems. Numerous studies suggest that prolonged screen time can directly impact concentration and memorization, especially in the younger generation who are increasingly reliant on smartphones.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, excessive focus on screens every day can lead to adverse consequences for children. As a result, using smartphones for specific purposes should be allowed and monitored by parents to ensure their kids spend time online in an appropriate way."}

This essay will elaborate on both sides of this debate before explaining why I believe that not all information should be accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people believe that information should be available to the masses. Sharing research results can improve the speed of innovations. For example, having discovered a new method of some disease treatment, scientists may involve funds for further investigations. Furthermore, spreading valuable information ought to broaden one\u2019s horizons. The availability of information causes people\u2019s awareness and increases their knowledge. Take for example public libraries, where people can gain access to a lot of information.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, individuals think that some data can lead to harmful repercussions for society. Spreading the information potentially may result in using it with bad intentions. Moreover, research findings in areas such as physics or chemistry could be used to create weapons that can threaten people\u2019s well-being or lives. Also, distributing specific information may violate the intellectual property of people or companies and can even lead to responsibility before the law. For example, a company can lose a considerable amount of money because of a leak of commercial information.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that some information can be profitable and helpful for people. However, it also can be dangerous. So, information is influential and should be shared carefully with the public."}

However, it is argued that travelling has negative influences on that particular area. I completely agree with this point of view because it may lead to crime and pollution of that destination.\r\n\r\nThe large number of tourists may cause a crime. It is undeniable that travellers bring  benefits to some particular countries. Since sightseers spend a considerable amount of money at the time of travelling, it could lead to an increase in the local businesses` income. But despite this fact, due to the throng of visitors in the bustling areas, there is a high chance for pickpockets to steal tourists` belongings elusively. This should be controlled with the help of the military or artificial intelligence otherwise their businesses will break down soon.\r\n\r\nIn addition, such a large volume of trippers can cause environmental problems to fragile habitats and historical sites. As holidaymakers may generate a massive amount of rubbish during the trip, disposal of this produced waste can be a challenging task for locals. Moreover, the mismanagement of litter can have a negative impact on the biosphere of that state. To illustrate,  Thailand has failed to mitigate water pollution and protect the natural environment due to the soaring amount of plastic rubbish left after the visit of tourists. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned, I totally agree that travellers from overseas are causing  damage to the destination travelled to. For one thing, an increasing number of visitors can create a crime, for another the environment may be altered and polluted by human beings."}

In my opinion, offering everyone free education by the government would be problematic due to the heavy pressure on the government's shoulders and its bad effects on the efforts of students.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons is that abolishing educational fees at all levels would put a tremendous burden on the suffering economy of most  countries around the world, especially developing countries. This means that developing countries have been struggling with fundamental issues, which are more crucial than literacy, and thus allocating some heavy financial aid to educational facilities would reduce the money for tackling  more essential problems including poverty, unemployment and the high rate of infectious diseases. For example, providing free education for people who are suffering from dangerous illnesses in underprivileged regions would not be advantageous for them.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor to consider is that eliminating educational fees in all grades might decrease the motivation of students. In other words, because of providing free of cost education regardless of students' scores, students would not be incentivised to work hard for better scores or take their studies seriously. Since free elementary, secondary and higher education are guaranteed for all pupils by the state, they are not motivated to put their whole heart into learning their lessons and be the best student for getting scholarships. For instance, the majority of young adults are trying to study hard and get full marks in university exams to be funded by famous British universities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, managing and providing educational materials and facilities freely would be problematic due to its financial aspects for most regions and decreasing level of motivation among students."}

This phenomenon occurred because of the unpredicted rise in world population, however, there are steps that can be taken to overcome this issue and the most effective one is making a trust-worthy prognostication by means of AI and data science.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is easier to raise kids compared to the old times. In addition, there are many places that are designed to take care of children or educate them when they are seven or older. That is the reason why couples find having two or three kids, worry-free and less risky. They can rely on these organizations for further assistance and bring up new family members and also work at the same time. In this way, having better circumstances to raise children has led to population growth.\r\n\r\nPresently, we are facing a boom in technology evolution and the best example of this is Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, there are servers which are capable of processing huge amounts of data and producing accurate results. So, by using the help of these modern options, we can train the population model on previous years' data and also predict its probable growth due to various factors, in the near future. Finally, having a point of view on how things will change can help us make better plans.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the problem of hunger in spite of the growth in agriculture is caused by making a false assumption and it is likely to be solved by using the maximum accuracy when we decide to make future plans."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "It is believed that rather than focusing only on gaining profit, organisations should contribute and should adhere to corporate responsibility towards the community. I completely agree with the aforementioned notion and the reasons will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a plethora of causes for the agreement with the above-asserted statement. In the modern era, big companies generally focus only on piling up money. However, they do not provide quality in return to the individuals. To be more precise, these corporations gain success only because of the public and once they get successful they forget to provide good quality  and authentic products in a race to earn heaps of money. Therefore, they should be involved in socio-economic activities. It is also essential for them to earn profit in order to run their business in an adequate manner.\r\n\r\nProbing further, as these companies earn a large amount of money, they can help to eradicate poverty from society. In other words, these huge companies can provide employment to individuals and should help them financially by giving an appropriate amount of salary according to their work. While a company is financially stable, it should be indulged in charitable social activities .For instance, during the corona pandemic, tata company supported their employees by providing them with adequate amounts for their survival in that challenging situation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although it is necessary for a company to earn money to manage their livelihood, they should provide people with desired quality  according to the price and help the community through donation practices."}

It sparked a debate regarding its necessity and effectiveness . I firmly disagree with this notion. My viewpoints along with some reasons will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, enforcing a curfew on youngsters restrict their personal freedom and curtails their ability to broaden their horizon. They should be given the freedom to discover their interests and independence. For example,  a teenager with a passion for music may be a part of the band and they mostly perform at  night. Thus, imposing a curfew can limit their approaches and  prevent them from sharing their talent in the community.\r\n\r\nProbing further, curfew often fails to address the root cause of juvenile delinquency.It is not certain that most of the crimes  are contrived at  night, they are even performed in the daytime. So, restricting the movement of teenagers is not the solution , it would rather make them more aggressive by not letting them  enjoy their teenage lives. Therefore, it will force them to do illegal activities and break the law to do  things in their interest.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although the  laws and norms are applied for the betterment of citizens, the root causes and the consequences should be kept in mind . Hence, it is not a law which should be  enforced on youngsters"}

Personally, I believe that both criteria should be given equal consideration. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, if we underestimate the importance of having good health, it might create a burden on the community. To be more specific, having an unhealthy body might lead to a variety of diseases, and people need to go to the hospital for treatment which sometimes occupies a lot of social resources, especially in countries that provide great social welfare. People might need to pay more tax due to the problems mentioned above. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we can get several benefits by maintaining a healthy body. First of all, people who have good health do not need medication and they could save a lot of money. Secondly, with a healthy body, people could be more productive at work which is definitely an essential factor in one\u2019s career. Last but not least, when we talk about well-being, it is not only physical but also mental. Lots of research has shown the importance of our mental health.

Nevertheless, private automobiles have been the cause of many environmental issues globally, and so, this essay will discuss a couple of solutions that could be implemented to reverse this problem. \r\n\r\nDaily usage of millions of cars brings about environmental issues such as air pollution contributing to breathing problems. Additionally, it also eventually thins out the ozone layer allowing harmful UV rays to enter the atmosphere causing skin cancer. To combat this, firstly, tax zone areas should be implemented in places that have a lot of congestion such as city centres, for instance. The more the public is taxed the less they are inclined to use their cars. \r\n\r\nweight gain is also a problem that comes about from the excessive use of cars. Many citizens that drive everywhere put on weight quicker, America, for example, is one of the nations that have the most morbidly obese residents worldwide. Therefore, I believe if more cities have pedestrian zones, the public would exercise passively as more local attractions would be easily accessible. Thirdly, carbon-free travel, such as trams which run on electricity, contribute to no pollution, will be an excellent addition to public transportation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, governmental authorities should implement a couple of these easy fixes right away as they would greatly impact the global environment and even people's health positively."}

The majority of people argue that  the existence of online viewers allows free them to read everything instead of purchasing paper-based media. I partly support this opinion.\r\n\r\nIndubitably, there are several measures why printed media is continuously popular among dwellers in the future. Foremost, interpreters can interpret attractive articles by journals which concentrate to announce dominant issues in their countries. Moreover, lots of companies in relation to the news have experts on checking the information and correcting proper words. As a result, subscribers easily allow main issues without fake and wrong delivery. Apart from that, online reading needs to connect with the network to access the internet to read.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, applying online services is beneficial to users and it will be the dominant media a few years later. Firstly, residents do not need to bring heavy items whenever they go outside. To be precise, they bring smart devices which are light and it requires the only a network to enter  online. For instance, they can bring more stuff when they go to cafes and other places since they have more space to keep their items. Besides, the internet gives us the possibility to download our ancestor's writing because most of them have already been copied by libraries which is hard to find original books.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, although it demonstrates numerous reasons why some people still advocate paper media, I am personally of the view that digital media will be dominant in the future."}

I think that anyone can live with their parents until they reach a certain age that they should move out of their house. \r\n\r\n     On the one hand, there are multiple advantages for someone to live at their parent's home. First, living at their parent's house with children ,especially grandchildren often makes them happy. Moreover, when living away from their parents' house  makes them feel sad because they might feel they will not see you again. Second, grandparents teach their grandchildren  past traditions. For example, some elderly in the middle east teach their kids how  life was in the past and how they adapted to it. Finally, this may also help the parents if they are ill. Nevertheless, when others learn that this country's civilians live with their parents for this reason this will boost their reputation.  \r\n\r\n   However, on the other hand, there are disadvantages to this case. Firstly, living with siblings may result in conflicts happening between them. In some ,countries statistics have shown that the number one factor to divorce is family issues. lastly, living with parents will not let individuals depend on themselves. Not only will this ruin the idea of people not being dependable but also not having the responsibility to do a task.

Although change may be unsettling for some, I consider the benefits of personal growth that generated by change exceed any disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, People resist change because their minds are used to certain circumstances. This means that people grow up with certain experiences and cultures. As a result, they form certain behaviours and beliefs. This makes it difficult for people to embrace change since it causes discomfort or undesired tension. For example, it is extremely difficult for an obese person to involve any change in their lifestyle. Moreover, even slight adjustments cause them give up and anxiety. However, I believe that a stronger support system can assist individuals to get over this issue and embrace the benefits of change.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, The advantage of change is that it brings growth into life. Either can be personal growth or professional growth. It makes people happy when they see them improving in certain aspects of life. People push their discomfort to see new boundaries, which allows them to see life differently. As an illustration, I used to start an occupation that I had never done before. I was hesitant in the early stages, but eventually, I slowly adapted and accepted the role change. As a result, it brings to tremendous growth on a personal and professional level. Therefore, it is possible to draw a direct correlation between change and happiness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people refuse growth because of the fear or anxiety they experience, but I once again restate that the benefits of embracing change outweigh the risks when we see how it adds to our happiness and fulfillment."}

Firstly, there is a major group of young people, who is less than eighteen years old, have very little practical experience and have very little intention of what goals they will direct. Consequently, staying at school until mature age will help them have a suitable environment to develop their education and time to think about their future career path. Moreover, compelling candidates to stay at the institute until eighteen will create a better-educated future generation of people, which may assist to reduce social problems and unemployment rates.\r\n\r\n    However, there is the figure of drawbacks that makes me disagree with this idea. It can be seen that many children these days do not fit in with the common education system and forcing them to remain at school can cause some problems. For example, these kinds of students are usually very disruptive in a classroom and this affects other students who are striving for study. Additionally, most students many children choose to follow careers that do not require them to continue studying in school past the age of sixteen. For instance, for those who wish to follow a career that requires more practical-based learning, such as a qualified builder, electrician, or machinery operator, it is quite unnecessary to remain at school until the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, although there are many beneficial advantages for children remaining at school until adulthood.

In this essay, I will elaborate reasons in more detail and provide my personal experience.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, educational events with certain purposes usually bring pressure and can be easily observed. When parents and educators intentionally required students to participate in some particular activities, they become unwilling to cooperate and tend to lose their motivation and curiosity on certain topics. Since, it is their nature that people hate to be forced to do something and so are youngsters, thus, planned events with some goals consistently backfired and ultimately killed the possibility for them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, facts are proven that non-educational events can also result in educational values. Playing basketball, for instance, is seen as a mere recreational sport. However, it is well-known that individuals who joined basketball teams have performed better leadership, negotiation skills and teamwork ability. This is because when a team is playing to win, it grows related skills mentioned that equipped themselves, and makes them capable of winning. Therefore, we can end up learning from those events who regards as only complete waste of time.\r\n\r\nRegarding my personal experiences, while often seen as a recreational activity, watching America TV shows (such as Friends) has brought unthinkable positive effects on me. Indulging in beloved dramas, my English improved to the next level since I was more familiar with its pronunciation and sentence structure. Surprisingly, it was events without a purpose that benefited me.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, educational events do not always reach their original goals, and possibly cased opposite outcomes. Additionally, entertainment can otherwise provide valuable educational achievements. Therefore, activities for teens should not be detailly planned, and certainly shall not always be educational."}

But instead of choosing one, I decide to choose both. In fact, if the government decides to allocate both, we will have lots of advantages for the entire nation.\r\n\r\nFor starters, railways are a meaningful invention that the ancients made. On average, the volume that trains can carry up to 300 tons of category, is beneficial to everyone. Railways capacity is more significant. Despite transporting people and goods as a huge mass, it still saves energy when running compared to other vehicles reducing environmental pollution. Regarding speed, rail lines facilitate faster transporting/ transportation. In the modern century, commerce sites connecting every means of transport are very popular therefore when people place an order, they tend to want it delivered today. The train line is a good choice for freight. Besides, since the train uses separate lanes, the problems to do with a high volume of traffic will be rectified and avoid unexpected crashes. According to lots of citizens\u2019 perspectives, it\u2019s safer and cheaper when we use railways. \r\n\r\nNext is roadways that have many advantages nothing less than railways. For starters, people are used to using roads, so investment in roads should be paid more attention. Streets are maintained periodically because it often has many potholes and slippery roads that are not repaired, making riders extremely nervous. Regarding the good level of happiness of the citizens, they feel contented with high-quality streets which offer them the convenience in commuting travelling time. At the same time, roadways also have flexibility. When the road is stuck, you can choose to take another route, and the locals or the map will guide you. Nowadays, if you have a problem with means of transportation, you can use the app to book the car therefore it is very convenient.\r\n\r\nIn general, spending money on both can be difficult for the national budget so there should be cooperation from private, public and environmental organizations to invest costs and reduce environmental pollution. Along with that, it is necessary for people\u2019s awareness to speak up and discuss the issues that people want to solve from there the government will focus on solving urgent problems\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, investment in railways and roadways is a good option to provide a better transport experience for people and benefit the whole society in terms of environmental protection and safety on the road."}

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working beyond retirement age.", "content": "As more and more nations age, more and more elderly are encouraged to continue working over retirement age. In my opinion, there are possible benefits and drawbacks of extending individual working life.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, working beyond retirement age can be beneficial in the following aspects. Firstly, continuing work improves the elderly's financial condition. More years in the job mean more experience, which in turn means more revenue. For skilled jobs, such as doctors, engineers and professors, people approaching retirement age tend to have rich experience and are also in the highest income period of their career. Furthermore, an elder person may find that having a job provides a sense of satisfaction. This is because people who have jobs have a sense of identity and feel they are part of society, which is necessary to maintain a good mental state. Not only that, but the active movement a job provides could help keep one\u2019s body healthy. As physical exercise is important for everyone, especially for the elderly.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are possible influences if people work after the average expected years. Obviously, it could damage their health condition. The older a human is, the more rest they need. When the elders do not get enough time to recover, it will pose a huge burden on  their bodies, leading to a series of physical problems, even death. Another disadvantage is that the interpersonal relationship can be affected. After investing so many years of one\u2019s life into a career, they deserve a life of leisure and family happiness. If they are still occupied with a job, there will be less time to do what they love to do and enjoy with their family. In that case, some of them may develop a lonely lifestyle. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are benefits and risks to motivating old people to continue their careers. It could maintain health and acquire a sense of fulfilment, meanwhile, it could also result in more exhaustion and solitude. For those who continue to work beyond retirement age, it may be helpful to replace manual work with mental work as much as possible."}

Discuss both views and give your opinion", "content": "Nowadays, music has become predominant in societies. However, other sectors of society argue that is mere entertainment for people. In my opinion, music assumes both roles, it is a way of entertainment but also plays a critical role in societies. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view to clarify my own opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is certain that music has been considered a way of expression but also a way of entertainment in different cultures over the centuries. For instance, every time there is a celebration, music is played, as well as people in their own houses like to listen to the radio because they feel better. However, music is much more than that. People who reduce the music only to a way to get distracted and get fun is having a very limited view of it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, considering music only as an entertainment pattern would be offensive to this magnificent humankind's creation.  For instance, there are records that music exists since humankind commenced to make their firsts technological developments, in which it has been demonstrated to be a way of expression, contributing to communication with others and the organisation of rituals. In other words, neither centuries ago nor in the present, music has been created to express and communicate emotions, ideas and a sense of energy, which also had an enormous impact on the audience because of its magnificence. This is why people may confuse the purpose of music with mere entertainment, as music has always been loved by humankind.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, music is an artistic expression that allows multiple interpretations, which also explains why some people could think that is only to get entertained, as music does not say how need to be interpreted or even understood. Although, we cannot deny that music is greater than that and we need to put it in the right place that truly deserves inside the society. Music is critical for our lives."}

Personally, I completely agree with this opinion for a variety of reasons and suggest some types of skills that are suitable for new employees,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in my opinion, I agree that the main mission of each university is perfecting the human inside of each student with tools which are social skills . Because of that, every university has to graduate with the type of skills or abilities that are making a difference with others so that students have a higher chance to succeed in their choices. So to make this idea more effective, I think that all education systems should eliminate courses that are not necessary for work. For example, politics is a subject that would bring nearly non-profitable value to any kind of student. Because each  student is experienced with that kind of morality course for about 10 years before going to university.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of skills that are needed by new employees. Firstly, it is communication skills which is the way we speak, and talk with co-workers, and how we persuade people in marketing is an aspect that nearly everybody forgets about it. The tone, speed, pitch of voice and speech is a combination that brings many values to us and it is kinda easy to achieve that. Secondly, time management skill is an ability that always needs in the working environment and normal life. It doesn't just give us confidence, high performance in finishing tasks. Furthermore, it creates a good attitude with the people working with you so you can make many relationships.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,Universities should bring out the skills that are needed for the community and teach that for students and communication is a great example of a skill that is suitable and helpful for working."}

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\u2019", "content": "Nowadays, modern society  believes that children should play outdoor games and spend time with family after getting home. Others argue finishing homework is more important. I will elaborate on these points and give my opinion in forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the importance of homework, it plays an important role in a pupil's life. If they would be given homework they can easily recall and memorise what they studied at school and also parents can track their progress by helping children finish it. For instance, if a certain chapter is read at school and juveniles are given questions to answer from that le lesson, they can revise it and  parents will also get involved in this and progeny will automatically become more serious towards their academic performance.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side of the coin, there are other measures which should be taken care of for the well-being of offspring. Family and teachers should encourage them to take part in other physical activities and extra curriculums. Because if one is not physically fit he or she cannot become mentally strong. For example, We should leave studying at school because that is why we pay fees. At home, we should spend time with kids and give them time to relax. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, we should not stress our youngsters about education every time. We should teach them other aspects of life like integrity and kindness. Schools are there to take care of their academics."}

Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.", "content": "A group of individuals present the view that reaching to enhanced economic situation is the key factor in a society and it will be a decisive factor in papulation's happiness, whereas others believe the improvement in other approaches is as vital as economic one. I strongly agree with the latter opinion since the importance of other human needs should be considered besides money.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, some people justifiably believe that prosperity in every field should be allocated by the governments. As these improvements offer a wealth of welfare such as security, accommodations, freedom and etc. From a medical standpoint, it is highly important to be healthy. Therefore, the reinforcement in the healthcare system is equally important as earning more money. Owing to better health circumstances, it is required a great education system as well. Consequently, the education system should nurture adept doctors and nurses. For instance, some African countries have been improving the basic amenities like better medical situation which has resulted in less suffering from a disease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group of papulation argue that earning a great deal of money is the most impressive trait of society. They insist that this action accelerates the process of achieving dreams and aims. However, I do not find this debate convincing as wealth no longer plays a crucial role in personal satisfaction. Despite the importance of property, people should be safe and healthy to utilize that earnings so as to their purposes. Moreover, prosperity in every other approach not only provides a higher standard of living but also boosts the greatness fleeing in a country. As a result, these other successes will be available, if the governments give a head to future improvement and not isolated to economy. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my view, although money is an integral part of life, other progresses solidify people\u2019s satisfaction as well such as reinforcing the health care system."}

I believe the statements that state any electronic media has bad effects on the community.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it cannot be denied that technology has helped people to fill their spare time, so watching television and playing some video games can reduce individuals' stress which has gathered. For example, some elders who have retired and no longer have activities, commonly, they fill their free time by consuming attractive dramas or movies which can entertain in order to keep fit and their mental health. In addition, playing some video games on gadgets for children this activity it is not only as entertainment but also can enhance their skills to solve problems that appear in video games. Therefore, problems solving skills will be very useful for provision when they are growing up.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Many channels are not responsible for their shows since they are only considering the movies that have been provided to gather as many viewers and the providers do not give quality shows in which quality shows can educate people, and the impact will make people to be more clever. Furthermore, despite the benefits of playing video games, there are many disadvantages if we allow kids to enjoy playing games excessively. Moreover, Addiction sources are not only from drugs, but through video games the addiction can infect the children who do it irresponsibly. Thus, essential tasks will be abandoned by the kids, such as homework, studying, and playing with peers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages and disadvantages by doing activities like watching television and playing games.

I 'm strongly agreed with this opinion\r\n\r\nFirst of all,  the Internet was a path leading to a new era that nearly everybody is knowing to apply. This is because the growth and expansion of the internet is pretty fast that can affect all over the world. From that, people have to change their usual life : chatting, streaming, making money on the internet and more. Reading newspapers or check is an activity that can be easily affected in this situation and have to make a change. For example, the number of newspapers or statement that are printed annually is decreased by a certain percentage every year. As a result, there is maybe no more printed data in the future.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the number of paper which is made from trees that are used to print newspapers or bill is enormous and highly cost. Because of that reason, the Internet is a great way to reduce those printed knowledge. From that saving, People can decline the money going out of their pocket and invest in online info which is way more effective to create profit.

I totally disagree with both opinions.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, working parents decide to choose childcare centres to take care of the lineage because they don\u2019t have enough time to spend with their children and the preschool session is an important period for the offspring to learn primary skills such as walking, reading and speaking so this place can teach these lessons. For instance,understanding the growth process will increase the offspring\u2019s capability, hence, the existence of a professional will help the parents while they aren\u2019t available to discover by themself. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, regardless of the growing process, the other side mentions that safety is very important. Despite the existence of professionals, however, they can\u2019t identify everyone\u2019s personality so they opine that family members such as grandparents will serve as another alternative solution. For example, the grandparents are the ones who know their personality so they can genuinely trust them to take better care of the offspring.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, instead of a variety of solutions, I think that the parents should look after themself because this period is the time that they will see their own son develop and learn.

Although economic progress is one of the criteria for the nation\u2019s success, I believe the social progress index should also be considered. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the growth of the economy is the main criterion that makes a country become great. The measurement of economic progress is GDP (growth domestic product) or the amount a country earns. America is one   example of a country which has high GDP index based on the world bank, and this nation also considers a top five successful country due to being one of the highest-income nations in the world. In addition, an unemployment rate includes a progressive economic rate in a country. When people have a job, they can afford their basic needs such as meals, accommodation, and bills. The less of the unemployment rate is, the more successful a nation is. The UK is one of the countries that has the lowest unemployment rate so  this country is one of the successful countries based on economic growth criteria.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, social index progress is an important factor that should be considered to assess a country\u2019s success. The social index progress includes how the countries serve their populations, human rights, access to education and health, and a fair law system. For instance, Denmark and New Zealand are two countries that consider to be successful countries based on  social criteria. Both countries treat their citizens really well. Populations in Denmark feel happy because of the measurement of social index progress; the employees feel satisfied with their work because their rights are fulfilled whether right as an employee or as a citizen in Denmark. It is also known that the index of worker turnover in Denmark is low. Although the GDP rate in Denmark is far less than in America and the UK, the index of happiness in this country is the highest among other countries around the world. This means social index progress is the far pivotal criterion to make a country great.           \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while economic factors are the criteria that make successful countries, I believe that based on the citizen perspective social factors are more significant in terms of a progressive country."}

Whilst acknowledging that there are drawbacks, this essay will argue that the advantages of this change will outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the predominant advantage of the moving away of companies is definitely the development of the countryside. To further explain this, the relocation of major companies to the countryside is going to increase the labour force which would in turn help in economic growth leading to more education and employment opportunities, hence causing the rural areas to develop. Another major advantage of the relocation of businesses would be reduced pollution levels in major cities. With the reverse migration to rural areas, there would be a reduced number of automobiles leading to less carbon footprint and decreasing greenhouse effect. For instance, The major city in India, Delhi, is ranked as the most polluted city in the country, because of  overpopulation and huge traffic problems.

One of the biggest drawbacks is the cost and time it would require to travel to work. People who live in the centre would now have to change their lifestyle and commute almost 30 to 40 kilometres every day to the job which would require not only plenty of time but also would cost a lot of money too, leading to elevated stress levels. For example, a research study done by  Harvard University showed that stress levels were more in an individual whose work was far away from home as compared to the one who loved nearby his job. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Although there are numerous benefits and drawbacks of moving businesses to the rural side at the same time,  the economic and  environmental benefits of the relocation of businesses are tremendous.

As a result of this situation, young people could focus on easily next academic session.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, most young people don't have any idea what to do in their future life as a business. This opportunity gives them to understand which activity fits their persona and character.

Others believe that it is important for young children to go to school as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think are the advantages of attending school from a young age?", "content": "In the modern era, there is a huge debate about most  people thinking that children should stay home and enjoy their lives until they are seven years old. However, others think that children should join  school at an early stage. A large group of people think in its favour. While others have the opposite opinion. The following paragraphs shed light on my personal opinion with a suitable example. \r\n\r\nI agree with the statement that children should not go to school at an early age. There are numerous reasons why I am in favour of it. The most important reason is that children are not understand everything at an early age. Their mindset does not accept easily new changes. As a result, they start crying at the school. Another pivotal aspect is that when children go to school at the age of 3 or 4, their development and creativity levels disturb. In other words, they start to focus only on their school-related subjects. Moreover, parents should allow their children to stay at home do extra activities and play different types of helpful games, which enhance their creativity power. To justify my stay of mind, I would like to give an example of a survey, which was conducted by Sydney University. The survey relieved the finding that in many developed countries there is a rule, they cannot start schooling before the age of 6 or 7  in the USA they start schooling at the age of six and in  Australia, they start at the age of seven.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, many people oppose the above-mentioned statement for many reasons, individuals believe that if they start their children's schooling late then children waste their time at home. In addition, children's interests may be diverted to some other activities. \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, according to the arguments aforementioned above. One can reach the conclusion that the benefits of  late schooling are indeed too great to ignore."}

What are the reasons for this? What should be done to solve this problem.", "content": "Nowadays, the issue of worldwide animal extinction has become a strongly debated topic. A wide range of species almost disappeared completely in the past few decades, while many others are close enough to do the same. This is due to the enormously increased human activity in their habitats. In my essay, I am going to reveal the reasons behind this, and I try to suggest some solutions as well.\r\n\r\nThe biggest reason behind disappearing most of these animals is hunting. For instance, in some Asian countries buying a tooth of a tiger on the black market is a very popular habit. This leads to the fact, that the illegal hunting of tigers is growing continuously. In addition, many other species are in danger related to global climate change. For example, the living area of polar bears is decreasing dramatically due to the melting of icebergs at the North Pole.\r\n\r\nAs long as the most likely reason for animal extinction is the human impact on their habitats, the solution must be also developed by us. According to hunting, the government should give a strong response, like a prison sentence for those, who hunt tigers illegally. Furthermore, reducing the emission of carbon dioxide can be effective to decrease global warming. This might result in the growth of the living area of polar bears again.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, human impact on wildlife has caused the extinction of some species. Both overhunting and global warming have serious effects on wildlife diversity. I strongly hope that mankind can solve these issues as soon as possible before it turns too late."}

Richer countries should now help poorer countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?", "content": "Numerous nations are becoming more affluent these days, whereas impoverished countries are getting worse. To tackle this, some suggest that it is vital to help low-income nations. I believe that the idea of supporting poorer nations is morally right and will reduce global challenges, including international migration. \r\n\r\nOne leading cause why giving monetary aid to poorer nations is that it is morally right. Because rich countries can afford to support people in distressed regions, it could be ethically wrong not to help suffering nations who lack basics such as food, water and medicine. This is particularly important during difficult times when high inflation and food crises impact disproportionately poorer countries. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, another primary reason why helping poorer nations is that it can contribute to the reduction of international migration. Factors such as lack of shelter, food and other essentials contribute to the increase of people escaping from their well-off countries to wealthier nations in search of a better life. Therefore, providing these nations with financial support in their homeland is crucial. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is also necessary that poorer nations take the initiative to improve their situations. In the long term, monetary assistance from Western countries is not sustainable because they will not be able to support other countries persistently in the long run. Authorities in poorer nations should, for instance, increase the quality of their institutions and create jobs and businesses. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, helping poorer countries is vital for different reasons, including that it can give us a greater sense of humanity, and diminish global migration, as refugees are supported in their places. However, governments in impoverished countries should engage in finding solutions for their problems and strive to create opportunities for their citizens, incorporating employment opportunities for their nationals."}

What are the reasons? What could be done to solve this problem?", "content": "Some people argue that most students have difficulty focusing on classes. This essay will examine the main reasons for this argument and possible solutions to it.\r\n\r\nMost of the students wake up very early for their busy schedules and feel sleepy in the first classes at school which makes it really hard to focus on any subject. Furthermore, there are generally many long and sequential course sessions, with boring and unattractive formats in general, with little breaks in between, which disables the students to recharge and energize herself/himself to get ready to learn new subjects. For instance, researchers published that teenagers' focus time is only 16 minutes, after that they got either distracted or bored. In that case, it does not make sense to hold up 40 mins sessions. In addition, technological devices such as tablets and smartphones are the top distractions, even one notification on the phone is enough to ruin the concentration of the students.\r\n\r\nA possible solution can be a new arrangement of the time and content schedules at schools considering the new generations' challenges and advantages. Maybe arranging shorter sessions with more little breaks can help students to concentrate better. Besides, the formats of the contents might be more fun with gamification and usage of more attractive visuals and experiments if applicable. Another solution could be prohibiting smart devices throughout the learning time which blocks the possibility of being disturbed by them when focused.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the misarrangement of time and content format and smart devices can cause students to lose their focus, even though rearrangement of the school days and prohibiting smart devices can help the problem."}

Others argue that zoos play an important role in wildlife conservation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "Nowadays, we have zoos all around the world to preserve endangered animals and to the purpose of introducing these animals to people. While some people think that zoos are necessary to protect wildlife animals others believe that this lifestyle is not acceptable for animals and should not be allowed. I will discuss both viewpoints and elaborate the reasons why I side with the latter opinion defending that putting animals in a small place for a lifetime is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, zoos might play an important role in protecting endangered species by providing them with essential conditions to survive. Since the biggest issue in the wild is difficulty to find food and water sources, zoos can help the animals by providing these basic needs. Furthermore, these controlled places might give a chance for treatment to animals with serious injuries and help to increase their lifetime. More than that, with controlled breeding next generations could be produced and animal genes can be preserved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, removing animals from their natural habitats can lead to a lot of problems such as an imbalance in nature. For instance, removing one animal from the food chain can affect all other species in the food pyramid. Therefore, as all the natural balance would be affected negatively changing the natural system should not be that easy. Besides all of these, putting an animal in a very small living place can cause a lot of behavioural disorders also. Consequently, these disorders will lead to other mental and physical conditions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some believers that menageries are necessary to keep wild animals alive and protect their generations for long years whereas others argue that zoos are inhumane places for animals as they are way smaller than animals need and change balance of the nature. I believe animal welfare is more important than everything and the protection of endangered species can be done without changing their natural habitats. I opine zoos have gone out of their purpose and have become touristic places only. Therefore, as a veterinarian, I believe as these conditions cause more problems than help, zoos are unacceptable places for animals."}

I will elaborate on these points and give my opinion in forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, in this cutting-edge era technology has provided society with a relief that they can effort from home, especially in developed areas. There are a lot of firms which give options to folk that they can work from anywhere. Some organisations even recruit people from overseas. This scheme has also provided them with additional benefits like flexible working hours. The only needed thing is a computer with an internet connection. For example, you could be living in the UK while teaching an online course to students from Australia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of parts around the world where this facility is not available to date. Because in some countries the Internet is not easily available. Another reason could be in some workplaces work environment which makes worker  more focused and dedicated. Online platforms are less reliable because of distractions. For instance, social media and games etc.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it depends on the firm and the public it is working for if it could reach or engage with the crowd online. Otherwise, the offline job would never be dissatisfying."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "School is an institution for feeding children and some people think this is everything for children's growth. However, we are not able to reduce the parent's effect on their kids. Parents are the basis of children. In the following, I will explain this view in more depth.\r\n\r\nFirstly, children have been grown from their parents all of their lives before entering the school. They stem from parents so parents are their personality's roots. School is the institution for developing  children's lives' knowledge to make them go to  society safely. I also grew up like these children. I learned basic social skills from my parents and go to the school which was the place to improve and apply the skills. Hence, even after children entered school, the parent's role is still available and influential.\r\n\r\nSecondly, children think that their parents are fundamental to their lives and  school is a part of their lifestyle. For example, when I was younger, I didn't think that school is more influential than my parents. I lived my life in school with the people skills which I learned at home and when after the classes finished I always thought that I was coming back to my parents. This is why I believe parents are more impactive than school.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, children's growth fundamental is their parents and this can't be ignored. School is a role in improving what children learned from their parents. Indeed, children also know that they are from their parents and school is a part of their lives. In conclusion, therefore, I disagree that school affects children more than parents."}

This essay will discuss pron and corn and who will tackle it.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, Nowadays, individuals faced a number of problems such as traffic because  the urban areas are hubs of industries and people are doing jobs and business in metropolitan cities for work. However, there are a plethora of facilities available kind as shopping malls, stores, hospitality and a modern lifestyle so people  attack  cities. For example, Ludhiana city is the most crowded city in Punjab it is  very famous for hosiery goods and there are numerous biggest industries as well as traffic and accommodation are large problems for individuals.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Due to industries natural air is polluted and everyone is aware of this problem So now the government takes steps against companies that are all industries shifted to the countryside so that, authorities develop and increase space for accommodation and solve traffic issues. while  there are many determinants like urban to rural areas and distance so far so it is very difficult for she/he and it creates traffic in also village areas. For example, companies need many things for imports and export  they spend huge money on transportation. Moreover, these companies add extra charges on products amounting to tax and delivery charges which is difficult for consumers and company expenses. For instance, I ordered a parcel from Amazon about they added a huge amount as delivery charges because there was no store nearby.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Government take a good decision because it is mandatory to remove traffic and accommodation problems.

High-speed internet has become widely available, leading to the increased popularity of social media. Most people nowadays possess at least one social media account. While some people argue that social media might be beneficial to some extent, I do believe that the massive use of social media is detrimental to our society.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it may be true that internet platforms may provide users with  opportunities to communicate with people around the world, enabling them to share ideas or inspiring stories. Also, in some ,people use social media for business. As we can see on Facebook feeds or Instagram posts, many young entrepreneurs advertise their original products on their social media accounts. Thus, social media indeed have advantageous effects. However, over popularity of these online platforms has created appalling effects on our society. First, loss of privacy. Teenagers and young people tend to post every activity that they do. For example, I see tons of videos and pictures that I feel are inappropriate to be posted publicly such as kissing, drinking or dancing half-naked. This, in my opinion, could exert negative consequences including crimes. \r\n\r\nIn addition, social media could also increase consumerism. Social media is full of artists and public figures who always introduce new trends in clothing or advertise cutting-edge gadgets. Indeed, the public will feel the pressure to buy or own the advertised products, even though they do not need them at all.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although social media may allow  users to keep in touch with their families and friends, I believe that it has detrimental effects on our society such as loss of privacy and increase consumerism behaviour."}

Why is it the case? To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "There is a controversial statement heating up a debate over the fact that some recruiters favour candidates who have formal credentials for study over those with only life experience or good personality traits in today's society. This essay will look at some causes of this and I personally do not have a consensus with this idea.\r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, academic degrees are valued more than life experience and character by some employers when they seek new staff. Because they believe that potential employees with an excellent qualification are equipped with in-depth knowledge and useful skills which play a crucial part in their future careers. For instance, some leading technology firms, namely FPT, Vingroup and so on, highly appreciate prospective workers who have Information Technology degrees or Internet Engineering certificates, therefore an improved quality of life for candidates who take them. Hence, taking academic background as a priority in recruit procedures exerts certain virtues.\r\n\r\nWhile the necessity of having a distinction degree is widely acknowledged, personalities and life experiences are vital for new hires as well. The majority of the skills needed for a job can be acquired through experience, which helps people deal with difficult situations more effectively. Take social and communication skills as two examples, these can be trained and practiced through experiencing ups and downs in life, so that it will make contributions to their jobs. Thus, it is detrimental to assess one\u2019s working ability based merely on their academic performance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although academic qualifications can have certain values, it should not be regarded as the only and the most important factor to select the best workers."}

Some people believe that it is a positive trend, while others think that it will bring negative effects. In fact, I side with those who think that technology brings positive impacts.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technology helps students to improve their abilities. In the class, many materials need improved technology to make the students understand better such as science. By having technology in the class, teachers can use many creative varieties in the class. For instance, students can see the real process of photosynthesis by using improved technology. As a result, the student can achieve academic success.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, technology can replace the teacher's position in the class. By providing technology in the class, teachers will get less interaction with the pupils. Many activities will be served with the technology. The teachers do not have to explain the material. For illustration, teachers just have to provide the video of the cells in the class without having an explanation from the beginning in front of the class. Consequently, teachers will not be the centre of the class.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, an increasing number of people using technology in class have controversy in society. Many people believe that it will make bad effects on the class such as replacing the role of the teachers. However, I am firmly convinced that having technology in the class will be helpful such as making the student understand the material better which can improve their academic success."}

Personally, I can neither completely agree nor disagree with this statement for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nI partly agree that people work and study from home is positive. One of the main reasons can be that working and studying with individual computers at home saves bulk time and money. This means that doing everything from home does not take commuting time as well as traffic fees such as vehicle tickets, and fuel. Another reason can be that using their computers at home make working and studying flexible time because computer technology is more and more easily accessible and cheaper. For example, anyone who works from home has time to work and take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the viewpoint that doing work and studying from home is positive. Firstly,  working and studying from home does not have the opportunity to debate with their colleagues and friends. For example, those who work from home cannot meet face-to-face colleagues to discuss a problem. Secondly, using individual at home is unmanaged by the supervisor of the company make them can lose focus while working. For instance, while using the computer at home make they play more games, not work.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although working and studying from home with the computer is more and more easily accessible and cheaper. I am convinced that working and studying from home brings more positive and negative others."}
