Do you think it is a positive or negative development?", "content": "In today's modern world, major companies use adverts to promote their products in a new way. In my opinion, I consider that design and slogans play a major role to attract many consumers and they have a positive impact on the profit of enterprises.\r\n\r\nOne reason is that some businesses work so hard to promote their products or services to a large number of customers in a new method in order to increase their profits. In other words, the main purpose of companies is soaring their sales by promoting their products with a unique design that includes a specific colour in order to attract more customers. They prefer to see something stylish since some aspects of modern life are tedious. The sales consequently will increase gradually.\r\n\r\nAnother compelling reason why some businesses choose to advertise their services with a new strategy is that they focus more on a large number of people as soon as to buy their products than others for the same purposes. That is to say, nowadays, major companies offer many employment prospects in the marketing field as soon as to come up with subtle slogans that can attract consumers to purchase their products. They choose a slogan that is  amazing and it attracts the attention of consumers everywhere and anytime. For example, a taxi driver can be attracted by a nice and simple slogan even if he does not see the adverts of the product on television or on social media.\r\n\r\nFinally, in my view, I think that individuals support companies that advertise their products in a new and attractive approach. When enterprises do a lot of efforts to reach the majority of the community, they will encourage and impulse people to buy their products significantly. Using new formats to promote products as a result brings more financial outcomes for companies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, offering their products in a new way by altering their designs and slogans are definitely advantageous for the purpose of lifting up the profit of the companies and attracting many customers. Businesses should work on the design and slogan of their products because consumers appreciate  creativity."}

However easy access has made analytical minds disappear although it also helps make tasks easier. I will elaborate on this in forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are many drawbacks to the Internet. People who use the internet are becoming dependent upon it. There are many platforms where solutions could be found for almost any situation. What one needs to do is just put some keywords and information would appear on the screen. So commuters do not need to make any research they can just copy the answer and paste it anywhere. For instance, chat GPT is an online platform which can leave many workers jobless in the future as teachers are being replaced by the internet.\r\n\r\nMoving to the benefits of the internet, it has made life easier. Information about almost everything is available just a click away. No one needs to study for hours to get to the conclusion. There are simple ways to solve problems, so no need to go to the traditional routes or formulae. For example, tasks could be done just by putting the equation and the answer will be there just in seconds or less, if asked what is pie, the web will show results and tell the source behind it.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, there are indeed detrimental to almost everything.

Some people think that it causes big problems. Others, however, think the ageing population has many advantages for business, government and for society in general. Discuss both views & give your own opinion", "content": "Due to the consecutive development of the standard of living, an average person\u2019s lifespan is lengthened. However, it has led to the state of an ageing population which is considered either to cause issues for authorities or to benefit the society. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of having an ageing citizen and through this essay, I will analyse the reasons for this assertion.  \r\n\r\nTo begin with, a shortage in the young label force could be seen as one of the gravest drawbacks to a country owning an ageing community. The dramatic decrease in the number of young dwellers has resulted in a reduction in the total of newborn babies per year. Alongside that, the elderly tend to avoid giving birth to an infant because their body can not accommodate the conditions of bearing a foetus. Therefore, there will be fewer options for the recruitment agency. Following that, the deficiency of new workers will deteriorate the country\u2019s economy. As industries require many employees with youthful strength and commitment to serve the needs of humanity. For instance, the service industry demands an immense volume of workers to operate.\r\n\r\nBesides, the ageing population also pressurises the economy with a tremendous amount of retirement pensions. As mentioned above, there are not enough staff which means that there will be no profits for the country\u2019s income. The potential of a country is evaluated through their workforce and economic sustainability. Not only in a shortage of money and being unable to pay for the social welfare but the nation also can not call for foreign investments. Therefore, the opportunities for country innovation in every area will decline without the help of other nations.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I believe that the drawbacks of an ageing population surpass the advantages of the effect of the old-aged workforce and the burden on the country\u2019s economy."}

Is this a positive or negative development?", "content": "Nowadays, in many societies, the youth have access to more freedom compared to the past. Whilst there are some drawbacks associated with this availability, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the primary advantage of having more freedom is that giving permission utilizing up-to-the-minute gadgets leads to the privilege of having access to higher education sources and reinforcing their knowledge. In addition, having access to technology not only provides teenagers with a wide range of information to enhance their knowledge but also plays an important role in order to find their passion for a specific subject which can be their future job. For example, some channels on YouTube can be highly beneficial for children to learn more about a particular subject which used to be unavailable. A further benefit of freedom is that the youngsters have the opportunity to express their opinions which brings about a greater development in their personalities and more self-confidence as well. For instance, children who have been asked about their ideas feel more invaluable and have a chance to accelerate their maturity process.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, giving freedom excessively can give rise to facing major problems. One disadvantage of freedom is that youngsters are more likely to be threatened by consuming cigarettes or other harmful drugs. Therefore, parents should allocate their children and raise their awareness about the detrimental effects of these behaviours. Another negative point of giving freedom is that teenagers can be prone to some dangerous tasks which can bring about vital issues. For example, being allowed to drive under the legal age may be prone for society.\r\n\r\nOn balance, it is true that giving freedom would seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive influences in terms of access to greater education and boosting their self-confidence outweigh the disadvantages."}

Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?", "content": "In today\u2019s world, the use of smartphones is very common, particularly among the young generation. Spending many hours on mobile phones has become a daily routine for some children. In my view, this is concerning and can be deemed a negative development due to the lack of creativity and potential hindrance in brain development. This essay will explore the reasons behind this case.\r\n\r\nNowadays, smartphones play an important role in people's lives. They serve not only as tools of communication but also as channels for online exploration. The perspectives on using phones freely vary depending on families and situations. Some parents might give permission to their kids for study purposes only because they could use the internet to find unlimited knowledge regardless of going to school. Others may allow phone usage for entertainment, such as watching cartoons on Youtube, as they believe it helps with relaxation.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks associated with uncontrolled phone usage. One significant issue is that when children spend more time on phones than going out to play with friends, they may lose social skills, which can lead to problems in their adulthood. Another adverse effect is that excessive phone use might cause health problems. Numerous studies suggest that prolonged screen time can directly impact concentration and memorization, especially in the younger generation who are increasingly reliant on smartphones.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, excessive focus on screens every day can lead to adverse consequences for children. As a result, using smartphones for specific purposes should be allowed and monitored by parents to ensure their kids spend time online in an appropriate way."}

This essay will elaborate on both sides of this debate before explaining why I believe that not all information should be accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people believe that information should be available to the masses. Sharing research results can improve the speed of innovations. For example, having discovered a new method of some disease treatment, scientists may involve funds for further investigations. Furthermore, spreading valuable information ought to broaden one\u2019s horizons. The availability of information causes people\u2019s awareness and increases their knowledge. Take for example public libraries, where people can gain access to a lot of information.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, individuals think that some data can lead to harmful repercussions for society. Spreading the information potentially may result in using it with bad intentions. Moreover, research findings in areas such as physics or chemistry could be used to create weapons that can threaten people\u2019s well-being or lives. Also, distributing specific information may violate the intellectual property of people or companies and can even lead to responsibility before the law. For example, a company can lose a considerable amount of money because of a leak of commercial information.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that some information can be profitable and helpful for people. However, it also can be dangerous. So, information is influential and should be shared carefully with the public."}

However, it is argued that travelling has negative influences on that particular area. I completely agree with this point of view because it may lead to crime and pollution of that destination.\r\n\r\nThe large number of tourists may cause a crime. It is undeniable that travellers bring  benefits to some particular countries. Since sightseers spend a considerable amount of money at the time of travelling, it could lead to an increase in the local businesses` income. But despite this fact, due to the throng of visitors in the bustling areas, there is a high chance for pickpockets to steal tourists` belongings elusively. This should be controlled with the help of the military or artificial intelligence otherwise their businesses will break down soon.\r\n\r\nIn addition, such a large volume of trippers can cause environmental problems to fragile habitats and historical sites. As holidaymakers may generate a massive amount of rubbish during the trip, disposal of this produced waste can be a challenging task for locals. Moreover, the mismanagement of litter can have a negative impact on the biosphere of that state. To illustrate,  Thailand has failed to mitigate water pollution and protect the natural environment due to the soaring amount of plastic rubbish left after the visit of tourists. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned, I totally agree that travellers from overseas are causing  damage to the destination travelled to. For one thing, an increasing number of visitors can create a crime, for another the environment may be altered and polluted by human beings."}

In my opinion, offering everyone free education by the government would be problematic due to the heavy pressure on the government's shoulders and its bad effects on the efforts of students.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons is that abolishing educational fees at all levels would put a tremendous burden on the suffering economy of most  countries around the world, especially developing countries. This means that developing countries have been struggling with fundamental issues, which are more crucial than literacy, and thus allocating some heavy financial aid to educational facilities would reduce the money for tackling  more essential problems including poverty, unemployment and the high rate of infectious diseases. For example, providing free education for people who are suffering from dangerous illnesses in underprivileged regions would not be advantageous for them.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor to consider is that eliminating educational fees in all grades might decrease the motivation of students. In other words, because of providing free of cost education regardless of students' scores, students would not be incentivised to work hard for better scores or take their studies seriously. Since free elementary, secondary and higher education are guaranteed for all pupils by the state, they are not motivated to put their whole heart into learning their lessons and be the best student for getting scholarships. For instance, the majority of young adults are trying to study hard and get full marks in university exams to be funded by famous British universities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, managing and providing educational materials and facilities freely would be problematic due to its financial aspects for most regions and decreasing level of motivation among students."}

This phenomenon occurred because of the unpredicted rise in world population, however, there are steps that can be taken to overcome this issue and the most effective one is making a trust-worthy prognostication by means of AI and data science.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is easier to raise kids compared to the old times. In addition, there are many places that are designed to take care of children or educate them when they are seven or older. That is the reason why couples find having two or three kids, worry-free and less risky. They can rely on these organizations for further assistance and bring up new family members and also work at the same time. In this way, having better circumstances to raise children has led to population growth.\r\n\r\nPresently, we are facing a boom in technology evolution and the best example of this is Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, there are servers which are capable of processing huge amounts of data and producing accurate results. So, by using the help of these modern options, we can train the population model on previous years' data and also predict its probable growth due to various factors, in the near future. Finally, having a point of view on how things will change can help us make better plans.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the problem of hunger in spite of the growth in agriculture is caused by making a false assumption and it is likely to be solved by using the maximum accuracy when we decide to make future plans."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "It is believed that rather than focusing only on gaining profit, organisations should contribute and should adhere to corporate responsibility towards the community. I completely agree with the aforementioned notion and the reasons will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a plethora of causes for the agreement with the above-asserted statement. In the modern era, big companies generally focus only on piling up money. However, they do not provide quality in return to the individuals. To be more precise, these corporations gain success only because of the public and once they get successful they forget to provide good quality  and authentic products in a race to earn heaps of money. Therefore, they should be involved in socio-economic activities. It is also essential for them to earn profit in order to run their business in an adequate manner.\r\n\r\nProbing further, as these companies earn a large amount of money, they can help to eradicate poverty from society. In other words, these huge companies can provide employment to individuals and should help them financially by giving an appropriate amount of salary according to their work. While a company is financially stable, it should be indulged in charitable social activities .For instance, during the corona pandemic, tata company supported their employees by providing them with adequate amounts for their survival in that challenging situation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although it is necessary for a company to earn money to manage their livelihood, they should provide people with desired quality  according to the price and help the community through donation practices."}

It sparked a debate regarding its necessity and effectiveness . I firmly disagree with this notion. My viewpoints along with some reasons will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, enforcing a curfew on youngsters restrict their personal freedom and curtails their ability to broaden their horizon. They should be given the freedom to discover their interests and independence. For example,  a teenager with a passion for music may be a part of the band and they mostly perform at  night. Thus, imposing a curfew can limit their approaches and  prevent them from sharing their talent in the community.\r\n\r\nProbing further, curfew often fails to address the root cause of juvenile delinquency.It is not certain that most of the crimes  are contrived at  night, they are even performed in the daytime. So, restricting the movement of teenagers is not the solution , it would rather make them more aggressive by not letting them  enjoy their teenage lives. Therefore, it will force them to do illegal activities and break the law to do  things in their interest.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although the  laws and norms are applied for the betterment of citizens, the root causes and the consequences should be kept in mind . Hence, it is not a law which should be  enforced on youngsters"}

Personally, I believe that both criteria should be given equal consideration. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, if we underestimate the importance of having good health, it might create a burden on the community. To be more specific, having an unhealthy body might lead to a variety of diseases, and people need to go to the hospital for treatment which sometimes occupies a lot of social resources, especially in countries that provide great social welfare. People might need to pay more tax due to the problems mentioned above. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we can get several benefits by maintaining a healthy body. First of all, people who have good health do not need medication and they could save a lot of money. Secondly, with a healthy body, people could be more productive at work which is definitely an essential factor in one\u2019s career. Last but not least, when we talk about well-being, it is not only physical but also mental. Lots of research has shown the importance of our mental health.

Nevertheless, private automobiles have been the cause of many environmental issues globally, and so, this essay will discuss a couple of solutions that could be implemented to reverse this problem. \r\n\r\nDaily usage of millions of cars brings about environmental issues such as air pollution contributing to breathing problems. Additionally, it also eventually thins out the ozone layer allowing harmful UV rays to enter the atmosphere causing skin cancer. To combat this, firstly, tax zone areas should be implemented in places that have a lot of congestion such as city centres, for instance. The more the public is taxed the less they are inclined to use their cars. \r\n\r\nweight gain is also a problem that comes about from the excessive use of cars. Many citizens that drive everywhere put on weight quicker, America, for example, is one of the nations that have the most morbidly obese residents worldwide. Therefore, I believe if more cities have pedestrian zones, the public would exercise passively as more local attractions would be easily accessible. Thirdly, carbon-free travel, such as trams which run on electricity, contribute to no pollution, will be an excellent addition to public transportation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, governmental authorities should implement a couple of these easy fixes right away as they would greatly impact the global environment and even people's health positively."}

The majority of people argue that  the existence of online viewers allows free them to read everything instead of purchasing paper-based media. I partly support this opinion.\r\n\r\nIndubitably, there are several measures why printed media is continuously popular among dwellers in the future. Foremost, interpreters can interpret attractive articles by journals which concentrate to announce dominant issues in their countries. Moreover, lots of companies in relation to the news have experts on checking the information and correcting proper words. As a result, subscribers easily allow main issues without fake and wrong delivery. Apart from that, online reading needs to connect with the network to access the internet to read.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, applying online services is beneficial to users and it will be the dominant media a few years later. Firstly, residents do not need to bring heavy items whenever they go outside. To be precise, they bring smart devices which are light and it requires the only a network to enter  online. For instance, they can bring more stuff when they go to cafes and other places since they have more space to keep their items. Besides, the internet gives us the possibility to download our ancestor's writing because most of them have already been copied by libraries which is hard to find original books.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, although it demonstrates numerous reasons why some people still advocate paper media, I am personally of the view that digital media will be dominant in the future."}

I think that anyone can live with their parents until they reach a certain age that they should move out of their house. \r\n\r\n     On the one hand, there are multiple advantages for someone to live at their parent's home. First, living at their parent's house with children ,especially grandchildren often makes them happy. Moreover, when living away from their parents' house  makes them feel sad because they might feel they will not see you again. Second, grandparents teach their grandchildren  past traditions. For example, some elderly in the middle east teach their kids how  life was in the past and how they adapted to it. Finally, this may also help the parents if they are ill. Nevertheless, when others learn that this country's civilians live with their parents for this reason this will boost their reputation.  \r\n\r\n   However, on the other hand, there are disadvantages to this case. Firstly, living with siblings may result in conflicts happening between them. In some ,countries statistics have shown that the number one factor to divorce is family issues. lastly, living with parents will not let individuals depend on themselves. Not only will this ruin the idea of people not being dependable but also not having the responsibility to do a task.

Although change may be unsettling for some, I consider the benefits of personal growth that generated by change exceed any disadvantages.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, People resist change because their minds are used to certain circumstances. This means that people grow up with certain experiences and cultures. As a result, they form certain behaviours and beliefs. This makes it difficult for people to embrace change since it causes discomfort or undesired tension. For example, it is extremely difficult for an obese person to involve any change in their lifestyle. Moreover, even slight adjustments cause them give up and anxiety. However, I believe that a stronger support system can assist individuals to get over this issue and embrace the benefits of change.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, The advantage of change is that it brings growth into life. Either can be personal growth or professional growth. It makes people happy when they see them improving in certain aspects of life. People push their discomfort to see new boundaries, which allows them to see life differently. As an illustration, I used to start an occupation that I had never done before. I was hesitant in the early stages, but eventually, I slowly adapted and accepted the role change. As a result, it brings to tremendous growth on a personal and professional level. Therefore, it is possible to draw a direct correlation between change and happiness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people refuse growth because of the fear or anxiety they experience, but I once again restate that the benefits of embracing change outweigh the risks when we see how it adds to our happiness and fulfillment."}

Firstly, there is a major group of young people, who is less than eighteen years old, have very little practical experience and have very little intention of what goals they will direct. Consequently, staying at school until mature age will help them have a suitable environment to develop their education and time to think about their future career path. Moreover, compelling candidates to stay at the institute until eighteen will create a better-educated future generation of people, which may assist to reduce social problems and unemployment rates.\r\n\r\n    However, there is the figure of drawbacks that makes me disagree with this idea. It can be seen that many children these days do not fit in with the common education system and forcing them to remain at school can cause some problems. For example, these kinds of students are usually very disruptive in a classroom and this affects other students who are striving for study. Additionally, most students many children choose to follow careers that do not require them to continue studying in school past the age of sixteen. For instance, for those who wish to follow a career that requires more practical-based learning, such as a qualified builder, electrician, or machinery operator, it is quite unnecessary to remain at school until the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, although there are many beneficial advantages for children remaining at school until adulthood.

In this essay, I will elaborate reasons in more detail and provide my personal experience.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, educational events with certain purposes usually bring pressure and can be easily observed. When parents and educators intentionally required students to participate in some particular activities, they become unwilling to cooperate and tend to lose their motivation and curiosity on certain topics. Since, it is their nature that people hate to be forced to do something and so are youngsters, thus, planned events with some goals consistently backfired and ultimately killed the possibility for them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, facts are proven that non-educational events can also result in educational values. Playing basketball, for instance, is seen as a mere recreational sport. However, it is well-known that individuals who joined basketball teams have performed better leadership, negotiation skills and teamwork ability. This is because when a team is playing to win, it grows related skills mentioned that equipped themselves, and makes them capable of winning. Therefore, we can end up learning from those events who regards as only complete waste of time.\r\n\r\nRegarding my personal experiences, while often seen as a recreational activity, watching America TV shows (such as Friends) has brought unthinkable positive effects on me. Indulging in beloved dramas, my English improved to the next level since I was more familiar with its pronunciation and sentence structure. Surprisingly, it was events without a purpose that benefited me.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, educational events do not always reach their original goals, and possibly cased opposite outcomes. Additionally, entertainment can otherwise provide valuable educational achievements. Therefore, activities for teens should not be detailly planned, and certainly shall not always be educational."}

But instead of choosing one, I decide to choose both. In fact, if the government decides to allocate both, we will have lots of advantages for the entire nation.\r\n\r\nFor starters, railways are a meaningful invention that the ancients made. On average, the volume that trains can carry up to 300 tons of category, is beneficial to everyone. Railways capacity is more significant. Despite transporting people and goods as a huge mass, it still saves energy when running compared to other vehicles reducing environmental pollution. Regarding speed, rail lines facilitate faster transporting/ transportation. In the modern century, commerce sites connecting every means of transport are very popular therefore when people place an order, they tend to want it delivered today. The train line is a good choice for freight. Besides, since the train uses separate lanes, the problems to do with a high volume of traffic will be rectified and avoid unexpected crashes. According to lots of citizens\u2019 perspectives, it\u2019s safer and cheaper when we use railways. \r\n\r\nNext is roadways that have many advantages nothing less than railways. For starters, people are used to using roads, so investment in roads should be paid more attention. Streets are maintained periodically because it often has many potholes and slippery roads that are not repaired, making riders extremely nervous. Regarding the good level of happiness of the citizens, they feel contented with high-quality streets which offer them the convenience in commuting travelling time. At the same time, roadways also have flexibility. When the road is stuck, you can choose to take another route, and the locals or the map will guide you. Nowadays, if you have a problem with means of transportation, you can use the app to book the car therefore it is very convenient.\r\n\r\nIn general, spending money on both can be difficult for the national budget so there should be cooperation from private, public and environmental organizations to invest costs and reduce environmental pollution. Along with that, it is necessary for people\u2019s awareness to speak up and discuss the issues that people want to solve from there the government will focus on solving urgent problems\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, investment in railways and roadways is a good option to provide a better transport experience for people and benefit the whole society in terms of environmental protection and safety on the road."}

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working beyond retirement age.", "content": "As more and more nations age, more and more elderly are encouraged to continue working over retirement age. In my opinion, there are possible benefits and drawbacks of extending individual working life.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, working beyond retirement age can be beneficial in the following aspects. Firstly, continuing work improves the elderly's financial condition. More years in the job mean more experience, which in turn means more revenue. For skilled jobs, such as doctors, engineers and professors, people approaching retirement age tend to have rich experience and are also in the highest income period of their career. Furthermore, an elder person may find that having a job provides a sense of satisfaction. This is because people who have jobs have a sense of identity and feel they are part of society, which is necessary to maintain a good mental state. Not only that, but the active movement a job provides could help keep one\u2019s body healthy. As physical exercise is important for everyone, especially for the elderly.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are possible influences if people work after the average expected years. Obviously, it could damage their health condition. The older a human is, the more rest they need. When the elders do not get enough time to recover, it will pose a huge burden on  their bodies, leading to a series of physical problems, even death. Another disadvantage is that the interpersonal relationship can be affected. After investing so many years of one\u2019s life into a career, they deserve a life of leisure and family happiness. If they are still occupied with a job, there will be less time to do what they love to do and enjoy with their family. In that case, some of them may develop a lonely lifestyle. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are benefits and risks to motivating old people to continue their careers. It could maintain health and acquire a sense of fulfilment, meanwhile, it could also result in more exhaustion and solitude. For those who continue to work beyond retirement age, it may be helpful to replace manual work with mental work as much as possible."}

Discuss both views and give your opinion", "content": "Nowadays, music has become predominant in societies. However, other sectors of society argue that is mere entertainment for people. In my opinion, music assumes both roles, it is a way of entertainment but also plays a critical role in societies. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view to clarify my own opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is certain that music has been considered a way of expression but also a way of entertainment in different cultures over the centuries. For instance, every time there is a celebration, music is played, as well as people in their own houses like to listen to the radio because they feel better. However, music is much more than that. People who reduce the music only to a way to get distracted and get fun is having a very limited view of it. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, considering music only as an entertainment pattern would be offensive to this magnificent humankind's creation.  For instance, there are records that music exists since humankind commenced to make their firsts technological developments, in which it has been demonstrated to be a way of expression, contributing to communication with others and the organisation of rituals. In other words, neither centuries ago nor in the present, music has been created to express and communicate emotions, ideas and a sense of energy, which also had an enormous impact on the audience because of its magnificence. This is why people may confuse the purpose of music with mere entertainment, as music has always been loved by humankind.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, music is an artistic expression that allows multiple interpretations, which also explains why some people could think that is only to get entertained, as music does not say how need to be interpreted or even understood. Although, we cannot deny that music is greater than that and we need to put it in the right place that truly deserves inside the society. Music is critical for our lives."}

Personally, I completely agree with this opinion for a variety of reasons and suggest some types of skills that are suitable for new employees,\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in my opinion, I agree that the main mission of each university is perfecting the human inside of each student with tools which are social skills . Because of that, every university has to graduate with the type of skills or abilities that are making a difference with others so that students have a higher chance to succeed in their choices. So to make this idea more effective, I think that all education systems should eliminate courses that are not necessary for work. For example, politics is a subject that would bring nearly non-profitable value to any kind of student. Because each  student is experienced with that kind of morality course for about 10 years before going to university.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of skills that are needed by new employees. Firstly, it is communication skills which is the way we speak, and talk with co-workers, and how we persuade people in marketing is an aspect that nearly everybody forgets about it. The tone, speed, pitch of voice and speech is a combination that brings many values to us and it is kinda easy to achieve that. Secondly, time management skill is an ability that always needs in the working environment and normal life. It doesn't just give us confidence, high performance in finishing tasks. Furthermore, it creates a good attitude with the people working with you so you can make many relationships.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion,Universities should bring out the skills that are needed for the community and teach that for students and communication is a great example of a skill that is suitable and helpful for working."}

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\u2019", "content": "Nowadays, modern society  believes that children should play outdoor games and spend time with family after getting home. Others argue finishing homework is more important. I will elaborate on these points and give my opinion in forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the importance of homework, it plays an important role in a pupil's life. If they would be given homework they can easily recall and memorise what they studied at school and also parents can track their progress by helping children finish it. For instance, if a certain chapter is read at school and juveniles are given questions to answer from that le lesson, they can revise it and  parents will also get involved in this and progeny will automatically become more serious towards their academic performance.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side of the coin, there are other measures which should be taken care of for the well-being of offspring. Family and teachers should encourage them to take part in other physical activities and extra curriculums. Because if one is not physically fit he or she cannot become mentally strong. For example, We should leave studying at school because that is why we pay fees. At home, we should spend time with kids and give them time to relax. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, we should not stress our youngsters about education every time. We should teach them other aspects of life like integrity and kindness. Schools are there to take care of their academics."}

Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.", "content": "A group of individuals present the view that reaching to enhanced economic situation is the key factor in a society and it will be a decisive factor in papulation's happiness, whereas others believe the improvement in other approaches is as vital as economic one. I strongly agree with the latter opinion since the importance of other human needs should be considered besides money.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, some people justifiably believe that prosperity in every field should be allocated by the governments. As these improvements offer a wealth of welfare such as security, accommodations, freedom and etc. From a medical standpoint, it is highly important to be healthy. Therefore, the reinforcement in the healthcare system is equally important as earning more money. Owing to better health circumstances, it is required a great education system as well. Consequently, the education system should nurture adept doctors and nurses. For instance, some African countries have been improving the basic amenities like better medical situation which has resulted in less suffering from a disease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, another group of papulation argue that earning a great deal of money is the most impressive trait of society. They insist that this action accelerates the process of achieving dreams and aims. However, I do not find this debate convincing as wealth no longer plays a crucial role in personal satisfaction. Despite the importance of property, people should be safe and healthy to utilize that earnings so as to their purposes. Moreover, prosperity in every other approach not only provides a higher standard of living but also boosts the greatness fleeing in a country. As a result, these other successes will be available, if the governments give a head to future improvement and not isolated to economy. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, in my view, although money is an integral part of life, other progresses solidify people\u2019s satisfaction as well such as reinforcing the health care system."}

I believe the statements that state any electronic media has bad effects on the community.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it cannot be denied that technology has helped people to fill their spare time, so watching television and playing some video games can reduce individuals' stress which has gathered. For example, some elders who have retired and no longer have activities, commonly, they fill their free time by consuming attractive dramas or movies which can entertain in order to keep fit and their mental health. In addition, playing some video games on gadgets for children this activity it is not only as entertainment but also can enhance their skills to solve problems that appear in video games. Therefore, problems solving skills will be very useful for provision when they are growing up.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Many channels are not responsible for their shows since they are only considering the movies that have been provided to gather as many viewers and the providers do not give quality shows in which quality shows can educate people, and the impact will make people to be more clever. Furthermore, despite the benefits of playing video games, there are many disadvantages if we allow kids to enjoy playing games excessively. Moreover, Addiction sources are not only from drugs, but through video games the addiction can infect the children who do it irresponsibly. Thus, essential tasks will be abandoned by the kids, such as homework, studying, and playing with peers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages and disadvantages by doing activities like watching television and playing games.

I 'm strongly agreed with this opinion\r\n\r\nFirst of all,  the Internet was a path leading to a new era that nearly everybody is knowing to apply. This is because the growth and expansion of the internet is pretty fast that can affect all over the world. From that, people have to change their usual life : chatting, streaming, making money on the internet and more. Reading newspapers or check is an activity that can be easily affected in this situation and have to make a change. For example, the number of newspapers or statement that are printed annually is decreased by a certain percentage every year. As a result, there is maybe no more printed data in the future.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the number of paper which is made from trees that are used to print newspapers or bill is enormous and highly cost. Because of that reason, the Internet is a great way to reduce those printed knowledge. From that saving, People can decline the money going out of their pocket and invest in online info which is way more effective to create profit.

I totally disagree with both opinions.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, working parents decide to choose childcare centres to take care of the lineage because they don\u2019t have enough time to spend with their children and the preschool session is an important period for the offspring to learn primary skills such as walking, reading and speaking so this place can teach these lessons. For instance,understanding the growth process will increase the offspring\u2019s capability, hence, the existence of a professional will help the parents while they aren\u2019t available to discover by themself. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, regardless of the growing process, the other side mentions that safety is very important. Despite the existence of professionals, however, they can\u2019t identify everyone\u2019s personality so they opine that family members such as grandparents will serve as another alternative solution. For example, the grandparents are the ones who know their personality so they can genuinely trust them to take better care of the offspring.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, instead of a variety of solutions, I think that the parents should look after themself because this period is the time that they will see their own son develop and learn.

Although economic progress is one of the criteria for the nation\u2019s success, I believe the social progress index should also be considered. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the growth of the economy is the main criterion that makes a country become great. The measurement of economic progress is GDP (growth domestic product) or the amount a country earns. America is one   example of a country which has high GDP index based on the world bank, and this nation also considers a top five successful country due to being one of the highest-income nations in the world. In addition, an unemployment rate includes a progressive economic rate in a country. When people have a job, they can afford their basic needs such as meals, accommodation, and bills. The less of the unemployment rate is, the more successful a nation is. The UK is one of the countries that has the lowest unemployment rate so  this country is one of the successful countries based on economic growth criteria.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, social index progress is an important factor that should be considered to assess a country\u2019s success. The social index progress includes how the countries serve their populations, human rights, access to education and health, and a fair law system. For instance, Denmark and New Zealand are two countries that consider to be successful countries based on  social criteria. Both countries treat their citizens really well. Populations in Denmark feel happy because of the measurement of social index progress; the employees feel satisfied with their work because their rights are fulfilled whether right as an employee or as a citizen in Denmark. It is also known that the index of worker turnover in Denmark is low. Although the GDP rate in Denmark is far less than in America and the UK, the index of happiness in this country is the highest among other countries around the world. This means social index progress is the far pivotal criterion to make a country great.           \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while economic factors are the criteria that make successful countries, I believe that based on the citizen perspective social factors are more significant in terms of a progressive country."}

Whilst acknowledging that there are drawbacks, this essay will argue that the advantages of this change will outweigh the disadvantages.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the predominant advantage of the moving away of companies is definitely the development of the countryside. To further explain this, the relocation of major companies to the countryside is going to increase the labour force which would in turn help in economic growth leading to more education and employment opportunities, hence causing the rural areas to develop. Another major advantage of the relocation of businesses would be reduced pollution levels in major cities. With the reverse migration to rural areas, there would be a reduced number of automobiles leading to less carbon footprint and decreasing greenhouse effect. For instance, The major city in India, Delhi, is ranked as the most polluted city in the country, because of  overpopulation and huge traffic problems.

One of the biggest drawbacks is the cost and time it would require to travel to work. People who live in the centre would now have to change their lifestyle and commute almost 30 to 40 kilometres every day to the job which would require not only plenty of time but also would cost a lot of money too, leading to elevated stress levels. For example, a research study done by  Harvard University showed that stress levels were more in an individual whose work was far away from home as compared to the one who loved nearby his job. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Although there are numerous benefits and drawbacks of moving businesses to the rural side at the same time,  the economic and  environmental benefits of the relocation of businesses are tremendous.

As a result of this situation, young people could focus on easily next academic session.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, most young people don't have any idea what to do in their future life as a business. This opportunity gives them to understand which activity fits their persona and character.

Others believe that it is important for young children to go to school as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think are the advantages of attending school from a young age?", "content": "In the modern era, there is a huge debate about most  people thinking that children should stay home and enjoy their lives until they are seven years old. However, others think that children should join  school at an early stage. A large group of people think in its favour. While others have the opposite opinion. The following paragraphs shed light on my personal opinion with a suitable example. \r\n\r\nI agree with the statement that children should not go to school at an early age. There are numerous reasons why I am in favour of it. The most important reason is that children are not understand everything at an early age. Their mindset does not accept easily new changes. As a result, they start crying at the school. Another pivotal aspect is that when children go to school at the age of 3 or 4, their development and creativity levels disturb. In other words, they start to focus only on their school-related subjects. Moreover, parents should allow their children to stay at home do extra activities and play different types of helpful games, which enhance their creativity power. To justify my stay of mind, I would like to give an example of a survey, which was conducted by Sydney University. The survey relieved the finding that in many developed countries there is a rule, they cannot start schooling before the age of 6 or 7  in the USA they start schooling at the age of six and in  Australia, they start at the age of seven.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, many people oppose the above-mentioned statement for many reasons, individuals believe that if they start their children's schooling late then children waste their time at home. In addition, children's interests may be diverted to some other activities. \r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, according to the arguments aforementioned above. One can reach the conclusion that the benefits of  late schooling are indeed too great to ignore."}

What are the reasons for this? What should be done to solve this problem.", "content": "Nowadays, the issue of worldwide animal extinction has become a strongly debated topic. A wide range of species almost disappeared completely in the past few decades, while many others are close enough to do the same. This is due to the enormously increased human activity in their habitats. In my essay, I am going to reveal the reasons behind this, and I try to suggest some solutions as well.\r\n\r\nThe biggest reason behind disappearing most of these animals is hunting. For instance, in some Asian countries buying a tooth of a tiger on the black market is a very popular habit. This leads to the fact, that the illegal hunting of tigers is growing continuously. In addition, many other species are in danger related to global climate change. For example, the living area of polar bears is decreasing dramatically due to the melting of icebergs at the North Pole.\r\n\r\nAs long as the most likely reason for animal extinction is the human impact on their habitats, the solution must be also developed by us. According to hunting, the government should give a strong response, like a prison sentence for those, who hunt tigers illegally. Furthermore, reducing the emission of carbon dioxide can be effective to decrease global warming. This might result in the growth of the living area of polar bears again.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, human impact on wildlife has caused the extinction of some species. Both overhunting and global warming have serious effects on wildlife diversity. I strongly hope that mankind can solve these issues as soon as possible before it turns too late."}

Richer countries should now help poorer countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?", "content": "Numerous nations are becoming more affluent these days, whereas impoverished countries are getting worse. To tackle this, some suggest that it is vital to help low-income nations. I believe that the idea of supporting poorer nations is morally right and will reduce global challenges, including international migration. \r\n\r\nOne leading cause why giving monetary aid to poorer nations is that it is morally right. Because rich countries can afford to support people in distressed regions, it could be ethically wrong not to help suffering nations who lack basics such as food, water and medicine. This is particularly important during difficult times when high inflation and food crises impact disproportionately poorer countries. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, another primary reason why helping poorer nations is that it can contribute to the reduction of international migration. Factors such as lack of shelter, food and other essentials contribute to the increase of people escaping from their well-off countries to wealthier nations in search of a better life. Therefore, providing these nations with financial support in their homeland is crucial. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is also necessary that poorer nations take the initiative to improve their situations. In the long term, monetary assistance from Western countries is not sustainable because they will not be able to support other countries persistently in the long run. Authorities in poorer nations should, for instance, increase the quality of their institutions and create jobs and businesses. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, helping poorer countries is vital for different reasons, including that it can give us a greater sense of humanity, and diminish global migration, as refugees are supported in their places. However, governments in impoverished countries should engage in finding solutions for their problems and strive to create opportunities for their citizens, incorporating employment opportunities for their nationals."}

What are the reasons? What could be done to solve this problem?", "content": "Some people argue that most students have difficulty focusing on classes. This essay will examine the main reasons for this argument and possible solutions to it.\r\n\r\nMost of the students wake up very early for their busy schedules and feel sleepy in the first classes at school which makes it really hard to focus on any subject. Furthermore, there are generally many long and sequential course sessions, with boring and unattractive formats in general, with little breaks in between, which disables the students to recharge and energize herself/himself to get ready to learn new subjects. For instance, researchers published that teenagers' focus time is only 16 minutes, after that they got either distracted or bored. In that case, it does not make sense to hold up 40 mins sessions. In addition, technological devices such as tablets and smartphones are the top distractions, even one notification on the phone is enough to ruin the concentration of the students.\r\n\r\nA possible solution can be a new arrangement of the time and content schedules at schools considering the new generations' challenges and advantages. Maybe arranging shorter sessions with more little breaks can help students to concentrate better. Besides, the formats of the contents might be more fun with gamification and usage of more attractive visuals and experiments if applicable. Another solution could be prohibiting smart devices throughout the learning time which blocks the possibility of being disturbed by them when focused.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the misarrangement of time and content format and smart devices can cause students to lose their focus, even though rearrangement of the school days and prohibiting smart devices can help the problem."}

Others argue that zoos play an important role in wildlife conservation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.", "content": "Nowadays, we have zoos all around the world to preserve endangered animals and to the purpose of introducing these animals to people. While some people think that zoos are necessary to protect wildlife animals others believe that this lifestyle is not acceptable for animals and should not be allowed. I will discuss both viewpoints and elaborate the reasons why I side with the latter opinion defending that putting animals in a small place for a lifetime is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, zoos might play an important role in protecting endangered species by providing them with essential conditions to survive. Since the biggest issue in the wild is difficulty to find food and water sources, zoos can help the animals by providing these basic needs. Furthermore, these controlled places might give a chance for treatment to animals with serious injuries and help to increase their lifetime. More than that, with controlled breeding next generations could be produced and animal genes can be preserved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, removing animals from their natural habitats can lead to a lot of problems such as an imbalance in nature. For instance, removing one animal from the food chain can affect all other species in the food pyramid. Therefore, as all the natural balance would be affected negatively changing the natural system should not be that easy. Besides all of these, putting an animal in a very small living place can cause a lot of behavioural disorders also. Consequently, these disorders will lead to other mental and physical conditions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some believers that menageries are necessary to keep wild animals alive and protect their generations for long years whereas others argue that zoos are inhumane places for animals as they are way smaller than animals need and change balance of the nature. I believe animal welfare is more important than everything and the protection of endangered species can be done without changing their natural habitats. I opine zoos have gone out of their purpose and have become touristic places only. Therefore, as a veterinarian, I believe as these conditions cause more problems than help, zoos are unacceptable places for animals."}

There are a lot of firms which give options to folk that they can work from anywhere. Some organisations even recruit people from overseas. This scheme has also provided them with additional benefits like flexible working hours. The only needed thing is a computer with an internet connection. For example, you could be living in the UK while teaching an online course to students from Australia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of parts around the world where this facility is not available to date. Because in some countries the Internet is not easily available. Another reason could be in some workplaces work environment which makes worker  more focused and dedicated.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "School is an institution for feeding children and some people think this is everything for children's growth. However, we are not able to reduce the parent's effect on their kids. Parents are the basis of children. In the following, I will explain this view in more depth.\r\n\r\nFirstly, children have been grown from their parents all of their lives before entering the school. They stem from parents so parents are their personality's roots. School is the institution for developing  children's lives' knowledge to make them go to  society safely. I also grew up like these children. I learned basic social skills from my parents and go to the school which was the place to improve and apply the skills. Hence, even after children entered school, the parent's role is still available and influential.\r\n\r\nSecondly, children think that their parents are fundamental to their lives and  school is a part of their lifestyle. For example, when I was younger, I didn't think that school is more influential than my parents. I lived my life in school with the people skills which I learned at home and when after the classes finished I always thought that I was coming back to my parents. This is why I believe parents are more impactive than school.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, children's growth fundamental is their parents and this can't be ignored. School is a role in improving what children learned from their parents. Indeed, children also know that they are from their parents and school is a part of their lives.

However, there are a plethora of facilities available kind as shopping malls, stores, hospitality and a modern lifestyle so people  attack  cities.

High-speed internet has become widely available, leading to the increased popularity of social media. Most people nowadays possess at least one social media account. While some people argue that social media might be beneficial to some extent, I do believe that the massive use of social media is detrimental to our society.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it may be true that internet platforms may provide users with  opportunities to communicate with people around the world, enabling them to share ideas or inspiring stories. Also, in some ,people use social media for business. As we can see on Facebook feeds or Instagram posts, many young entrepreneurs advertise their original products on their social media accounts. Thus, social media indeed have advantageous effects. However, over popularity of these online platforms has created appalling effects on our society. First, loss of privacy. Teenagers and young people tend to post every activity that they do. For example, I see tons of videos and pictures that I feel are inappropriate to be posted publicly such as kissing, drinking or dancing half-naked. This, in my opinion, could exert negative consequences including crimes. \r\n\r\nIn addition, social media could also increase consumerism. Social media is full of artists and public figures who always introduce new trends in clothing or advertise cutting-edge gadgets. Indeed, the public will feel the pressure to buy or own the advertised products, even though they do not need them at all.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although social media may allow  users to keep in touch with their families and friends, I believe that it has detrimental effects on our society such as loss of privacy and increase consumerism behaviour."}

Why is it the case? To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "There is a controversial statement heating up a debate over the fact that some recruiters favour candidates who have formal credentials for study over those with only life experience or good personality traits in today's society. This essay will look at some causes of this and I personally do not have a consensus with this idea.\r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, academic degrees are valued more than life experience and character by some employers when they seek new staff. Because they believe that potential employees with an excellent qualification are equipped with in-depth knowledge and useful skills which play a crucial part in their future careers. For instance, some leading technology firms, namely FPT, Vingroup and so on, highly appreciate prospective workers who have Information Technology degrees or Internet Engineering certificates, therefore an improved quality of life for candidates who take them. Hence, taking academic background as a priority in recruit procedures exerts certain virtues.\r\n\r\nWhile the necessity of having a distinction degree is widely acknowledged, personalities and life experiences are vital for new hires as well. The majority of the skills needed for a job can be acquired through experience, which helps people deal with difficult situations more effectively. Take social and communication skills as two examples, these can be trained and practiced through experiencing ups and downs in life, so that it will make contributions to their jobs. Thus, it is detrimental to assess one\u2019s working ability based merely on their academic performance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although academic qualifications can have certain values, it should not be regarded as the only and the most important factor to select the best workers."}

Some people believe that it is a positive trend, while others think that it will bring negative effects. In fact, I side with those who think that technology brings positive impacts.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technology helps students to improve their abilities. In the class, many materials need improved technology to make the students understand better such as science. By having technology in the class, teachers can use many creative varieties in the class. For instance, students can see the real process of photosynthesis by using improved technology. As a result, the student can achieve academic success.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, technology can replace the teacher's position in the class. By providing technology in the class, teachers will get less interaction with the pupils. Many activities will be served with the technology. The teachers do not have to explain the material. For illustration, teachers just have to provide the video of the cells in the class without having an explanation from the beginning in front of the class. Consequently, teachers will not be the centre of the class.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, an increasing number of people using technology in class have controversy in society.

One of the main reasons can be that working and studying with individual computers at home saves bulk time and money. This means that doing everything from home does not take commuting time as well as traffic fees such as vehicle tickets, and fuel. Another reason can be that using their computers at home make working and studying flexible time because computer technology is more and more easily accessible and cheaper. For example, anyone who works from home has time to work and take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the viewpoint that doing work and studying from home is positive. Firstly,  working and studying from home does not have the opportunity to debate with their colleagues and friends. For example, those who work from home cannot meet face-to-face colleagues to discuss a problem. Secondly, using individual at home is unmanaged by the supervisor of the company make them can lose focus while working.

This essay will discuss the reasons behind this phenomenon and provide practical solutions to address the issue.\r\n\r\nPeople purchase consumptions that they do not need and get into debt because they lack basic knowledge of personal asset management. That is because the education system we have in the contemporary era only focuses on theoretical knowledge without providing basic tools for students to live their daily lives, leading to a sufficient sense of investment and saving after they grow up. Therefore, people tend to use every quarter in their pocket for consumption without considering their financial situations, and this can harm them in the long term as they need to work twice hard to pay back their debts and have no time for further developments in both personal and professional settings. For example, according to a survey about college graduates in China, the major problem of their school curriculums is the lack of basic finance and investment courses, which may prevent them from over-consumption after they graduate.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem, the general public, financial institutions and governments should act together in an endeavour. On an individual level, people can use the Internet to self-study related knowledge about asset management and proper consumption behaviours. In addition, banks and other financial authorities should publish more strict regulations to loan money to people for consumption, which can prevent people from over-consumption in the early stage. Finally, governments should restrict education systems by adding financial courses into curricula, teaching students from primary school, and developing their purchase hygiene gradually. For instance, the Japanese government forced all the elementary schools to set up a pocket money course in which students can learn about the different ways to use their money and the according results, which was highly commented by citizens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some people struggle with their consumption debts for useless things because they have insufficient knowledge about asset management and have no plan for their consumption in advance. All the individuals by learning financial knowledge, banks by setting strictly examining progress of loan, and governments by adjusting curriculums and adding consumption practices for students can help to address the issue."}

I totally agree with this opinion due to the reasons which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, humankind has been always attracted to  sounds and rhythms, even from the time he lived in a cave and the only available music was the sound of nature which was mainly produced by water and wind movements or animals. So this characteristic is rooted in our souls. No matter where a person was born or what culture he grew up in, there is a special kind of song which will absorb his attention. Recent research and investigations show that even wildlife creatures, such as birds or camels can understand music and sync their movements with it, and there is no doubt that humans are absolutely ahead of them in this area.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, expressing feelings and opening up can bring people together and as we know a vital role of song is talking about feelings which are commonly hidden or forgotten to show. These days, there are many applications like the website which is called Genius that provide lyrics and the metaphors or symbols which are behind them. society usually leaves their own opinions or vote for other\u2019s ideas and even in some cases, they have long discussions over albums or tracks that have been released recently or a long time ago. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, music was popular among human beings from the very beginning of their lives and it is the food of their souls, and it also can be a bridge for transferring emotions facts that are not usually discussed without the existence of songs because people find it difficult to expose them. As discussed in the above paragraphs, I totally agree with the idea that song is a good way of bringing people of different ages and nations together."}

It shows that this capability will be increasingly commonplace in all countries as well as learning this kind of mastery will give us tremendous opportunities in the future. For example, many influencers such as Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and so on, specialized not only in public speaking but also in charisma which is important to attract someone's attention.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in some highly developed countries schools, teach their pupils how to speak in front of many nations, as a result, a study has proven that most of them greatly impact their jobs and get success easily because public speaking is more improved than the other staff.

What are the reasons? What could be done to solve this problem?", "content": "Many learners struggle to focus in different learning institutions. The reasons for this are that the human brain has a limited time limit for concentrating, and students have many distractions at school, such as friends and sports. These challenges can be resolved by creating many breaks during learning and making the learning process interesting or fun. It is also prudent to set aside time for school work or study to curb the effects of distractions. This essay will discuss these matters at length. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is difficult for many students to concentrate at school because the human brain can only concentrate for a short period, the reason why many lessons are scheduled with several breaks. Likewise, there are so many distractions at school such as friends and sporting activities; these divert attention away from learning. For example, it has been found by studies in several schools in the USA, that when students make friends, they stop paying attention to their studies and become interested in games and leisure activities with their mates. \r\n\r\nTo resolve these issues, first, parents and teachers should assist the learners to create and follow set timetables for individual study. At such times, they must give all their attention to learning rather than playing. Secondly, learning institutions need to create many breaks for students so that their brains can regain composure and strength; learning must also be made more fun, as in the case of many learn-through-play activities which allow for more relaxation and concentration. For instance, in the same studies conducted in the USA, it was found that teachers resorted to using games and other interactive learning methods to promote concentration. These improved the pass rates in the schools surveyed. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, therefore, focusing at school is a problem for learners because of the distractions they encounter, such as their friends, but also because their brains can only assimilate small amounts of information at a time. The solutions to these issues are to make learning fun and to create as many breaks as possible to re-energise the brain. These are the issues the essay has discussed."}

To explain it, the majority of the extra disciplines are most likely simple and interesting, which helps enlistment to keep their minds fresh. It is also advantageous in a way so that they can think out of the box and make some strong decisions in different aspects of life.For instance, a survey conducted by oxford university in Britain found that 33% of individuals have different jobs as compared to their degrees.\r\n\r\nOther opinions said that by studying subjects according to their qualification, recruitment will be much more comfortable and enjoyable and this will make them feel more confident to deal with various challenges in the learning process.

This essay will argue about these experiences and the alternatives that already exist. \r\n\r\nIn the early twenty century, animals were vital for experiments in order to obtain knowledge and learn about the body system's works. Because of them, in all these years, everybody can take medicine and use cosmetic products safely. For instance, in the past, animal test had not used in a specific type of medicine for pregnancy, and the result was the members deformation of many babies, as well as an eyelash cosmetic that was also not tested on animals which ended up to made blind people who used it. Therefore, humanity's health security enhance, and the lifespan grew due to animal experiments. \r\n\r\nCurrently, advancing technology is paramount to reducing these tests, and more comprehension of the cruelty methodology used is essential to change the methods to avoid animal suffering.

For example, the Natura and Boticario Brazilian companies have not done any tests on animals for roughly twenty years. Hence, the development of biotechnology could reduce the usefulness of animals.\r\n\r\nIn summary, this essay approached the evolution of animal tests' necessity in the past and how they could be replaced throughout the years by the advance of technology."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "The problems governments face nowadays are often shared by other countries. Many regions of the world suffer from extreme weather, internet crime and large population movements. Is it better to deal with these problems through collaboration or competition? I believe that competition is more effective.\r\n\r\nFirstly, collaboration can be a very slow process. Although communication technology has improved greatly, countries that choose to collaborate still must work together across great distances using different languages. Relationships between leaders may develop slowly or even deteriorate as they negotiate across linguistic and cultural divisions. Political leaders may therefore lose trust in each other.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for my view is that attempts to collaborate are often unsuccessful. Countries with different aims and values often find it hard to work together, and the need to compromise often means that solutions become less effective. International agreements on climate change, for example, tend to lack ambition. Any failure to agree may even damage relationships between states. But if countries act individually, they can act more quickly and other countries might then gain from their experience.\r\n\r\n Lastly, I think that people tend to work harder when they compete. In the same way that businesses innovate in response to competition, competing countries may look for innovative solutions as they try to win respect from the international community. In fact, as a result of competition, several quite different solutions may be developed, and the world may benefit from a greater range of options.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, collaboration represents a less effective process for solving problems than competition. There will always be some need to collaborate, for example, when resolving conflict. But if we want to solve problems, it\u2019s essential that we take advantage of friendly competition."}

Do you thing this is a positive or a negative development?", "content": "More and more individuals are turning to alternative medicines and treatments instead of seeking traditional medical advice. In my view, this trend is concerning and can be deemed as a negative development due to the potential risks involved, such as inappropriate cures and financial exploitation.\r\n\r\nOne significant drawback of opting for unconventional treatments is the risk of exacerbating health issues. People may seek alternative options due to various reasons, such as financial constraints, prior unsuccessful treatments, or living in remote areas. However, if they receive treatment from individuals lacking proper medical knowledge, it can be hazardous to their well-being. Relying on medicines from unreliable sources or the internet may adversely affect the patient's symptoms, leading to a deterioration of their health condition.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this growing inclination towards alternative treatments presents an opportunity for scammers to take advantage of vulnerable patients. Desperate for relief from their ailments, some patients might fall prey to fraudulent individuals offering expensive yet baseless guarantees of a cure. Those who have lost hope in traditional medicine become susceptible to these scams, unknowingly subjecting themselves to financial exploitation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the popularity of alternative treatments may be on the rise, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks associated with such practices. Opting for treatments without proper medical guidance can lead to adverse consequences for patients, jeopardizing their health and finances. Therefore, it is imperative for individuals to exercise caution and seek advice from qualified medical professionals to ensure the best possible care and outcomes for their well-being."}

How true do you think this statement is? What measures can governments take to discourage people from owning cars?", "content": "The entire world is fascinated by technical breakthroughs in this fast-advancing scientific era. Over the past three decades, car ownership has increased significantly and at a never-before-seen rate. Traffic is now extremely congested as a result of this. In my opinion, governments may undoubtedly start some suggested efforts to control this threat.\r\n\r\nSetting the stage for the discussion, the purchase and use of private cars have evolved significantly during the past few decades. The flexibility of commuting is probably the most significant of the many reasons why many people prefer to possess their own automobiles. Many people also express great enthusiasm for the new vehicles that have been introduced to the market since they have advanced features, innovation, security features, and luxury. As a result, there are more vehicles on the road than the roads and passengers can handle, which leads to traffic congestion. Furthermore, many governments in developing nations take the least care to construct additional roads and appropriate parking spaces, and their actions further exacerbate the traffic issues.\r\n\r\nSupporting my viewpoint further, governments can impose strict rules to cut down on car ownership and manage traffic jams. In order to decrease the chaos caused by traffic jams, the government should prioritize developing enough parking lots, new highways, and flyovers. It should also actively promote encouraging individuals to walk and ride bikes wherever possible. Additionally, the government has to persuade commuters to ditch their automobiles in favour of less expensive public transit options like buses and metro trains. Finally, and most crucially, the government must raise auto ownership taxes while also enhancing public transportation options to deter as many people as possible from buying cars.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, strong steps should be taken by the appropriate authorities to limit the number of cars on the road in order to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. congestion. In addition, individuals should be educated on the advantages of biking and walking as modes of transportation."}

In this essay, I will explain some reasons behind both these points of view as well as express the reason why I am on the first side.\r\n\r\nTo proponents of advertising, it is an undeniable fact that it still has its popularity among each society due to some points. The main obvious one is that if they were skillfully designed, they would hit the market with an influx of customers. In other words, the role of using fascinating visual effects has become highlighted so that it can be still a compelling way in which products can be sold. Another further reason would be that although the market competition has been fierce in the last decade, advertising is still the first and foremost way to persuade people to buy some products, but it has just changed its platforms. For example, advertisements had been shown on television in the gap between two movies in the past, however, it has been represented on YouTube or the Netflix website now.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, opponents of advertisement efficiency believe that with the influx of different kinds of advertisement, they have lost their functions so people are not persuaded by them anymore. They consider this competitive market a recession of advertising, not a chance to boost its quality.  for instance, many elderlies skip the advertisements between the program they are watching because they believe all of them are designed to deceive them. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that some people do not agree with the functions of ads, I firmly believe that ads can be kept in their publicity as long as experts are professional enough to make ads in an appealing way."}

However, in several parts of the world, there is a phenomenon that married couples taking the decision not to have children during their life. In this essay, I will outline the benefits and drawbacks of this issue in our society\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, being childfree will give more time for married people to focus on their job to achieve higher positions in the workplace which will lead to higher productivity and their financial condition will be more stable to satisfy daily needs. Besides, this decision will reduce overpopulation in some countries which is the main source of social and economic problems such as poverty and famine because of lack of access to higher education and healthcare, for instance in India and China. The statistic shows that only 5% of the population in these countries have the opportunity to pursue higher education which leads to a huge economic gap.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this decision will give adverse consequences for the economic condition because the availability of the workforce will be reduced and lead to steady economic growth in the long run. For example, in Japan, most of their population is dominated by those above 50 years and in the last 20 years, their economic growth is less than 2% a year because of the shortage of labour in various economic sectors since married couples deciding not to have children.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I contend that childfree has more disadvantages than its advantage because it will cause detrimental effects on the economic growth of a country in the long run due to a lack of labour in various economic sectors."}

Most manufacturers and enterprises' employees will stay  live in the big city due to facility availability. Therefore, employees will have a high mobilization from the city to the work area.

Besides, the waste as well as pollution that resulted from companies\u2019 activity will not disrupt people who live in the city.

When people travel to space to explore it, they need some stuff, such as a rocket which is expensive and undoubtedly it causes air pollution because of the emissions of greenhouse gasses. Moreover, they need a source of energy which will be used by the rocket, namely gas, petrol and electricity. As a result, these outlays will be spent by the government, while some countries can not afford this amount of money, and they need to spend it on essential needs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, according to some,  it is important to discover if there is somewhere else to live in this solar system or not and to know what people are surrounded by. When people move to the universe and discover the space there will be more places to live in because many countries are suffering from overpopulation. Furthermore, the universe can have other sources and opportunities for living and working there. This is because when the astronauts find other places, they need  employment and citizens there, which will be useful for humans. For instance,  many engineers will have more opportunities to work in this industry because they can create more sophisticated machines  for these expeditions.Thus,  it is important to explore the universe. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although people may vary in their opinions, I think that space exploration is a waste of money and dangerous.

In this essay, I will further discuss my viewpoint. \r\n\r\nFirstly, i strongly agreed with the idea of having useful instructions in the form of policy for people who are new to parenting as this would be beneficial for a lot of reasons. For instance, if the minor is experiencing an emergency and in need of urgent and special medical attention; if the parents are equipped with emergency rescue techniques or knowledge, they would know how to properly react and keep their offspring safe. Furthermore, raising a kid well could help society thrive by having healthy, competent future citizens that additionally would passively reduce the funding to healthcare for unnecessary health problems that could have been devoided if the parents are knowledgeable;  also a high competency citizen could serve  society better. \r\n\r\nWith that being said about the pros of attending a plan for taking care of a youngster, conversely, there are some other factors to consider. Firstly, to reap the good results of the course, it would need well-trained educators in multidisciplinary including health, the science of child development, psychology, nutrition and many more sub-speciality. Secondly, the cost of attending these programs should be taken to account and the government should lend a helping hand in both providing funding and raising awareness for the people. It can be seen that there are many more factors regarding these subjects and it could hinder the idea of creating a learning environment for couples who need education. Additionally, if these factors and quality are met, the program would be an absolutely essential skill in every person's repertoire. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the incentive of parents going to courses providing education related to bringing up the youth is very important and could hence be beneficial in numerous ways, nevertheless, to actually build a viable and realistically useful place for parents to receive training would need the cooperation of the whole society."}

First of all, In the academy, they can improve their confidence and communication skills. For example, In the education centre, they have to take part in competitions and do assignments in a team or alone, which will help to improve self- steam and communication skills. Apart from this, these skills also help in later life to compete with their co-workers and competitors. Secondly, in the institute, they learn sports, cooking skills, dancing and singing with academic skills. These skills are impossible to teach at the house.\r\n\r\non the other hand, if young people learn at home from their parents and family members then it will help to save money and time which they spend to take admission to the hall and use transport to go to the academy such as bus or van.

I believe living in houses offers numerous advantages, such as increased living space and a greater sense of private life when compared to residing in apartments. \r\n\r\nThere are more benefits to dwelling in houses. Firstly, they are often more spacious and family-friendly than flats. This is important for many people, in particular, larger families who need spacious rooms in which they can live together with comfort. Secondly, houses are usually built with considerable spaces between them.  That is to say, those who live in houses might keep their lives secret. In contrast, apartments are close and in the same building block, meaning that your neighbours can easily hear what is happening in your accommodation. For instance, my brother, who is a doctor and has his own house in Kent in the UK, enjoys living in a quiet house that is not close to other accommodations.\r\n\r\nDespite these advantages, living in houses has its drawbacks. One disadvantage is that it is challenging to maintain hygienic standards. This is because such buildings cover a large area which requires more cleaning. In fact, people who live in houses not only do they need to clean inside their spacious dwellings but also their gardens; both the front and the back yards are to be taken into consideration. Another drawback is that the prices of houses are considerably higher than apartments. As a consequence, low- and middle-class families cannot afford to buy them. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, residing in houses provides various benefits, including creating a family-oriented environment and enjoying a sense of privacy. However, the need for extra house cleaning can deter certain individuals from buying. Moreover, not all people can buy them because of the enormous price required."}

This habit not only can lead to extravagant spending but can also develop the habit of showing off which can bleakly affect during the lows of one\u2019s life.

Thus, they usually spend time at home during the weekend to do their house chores and with their family. Secondly, the quality of the art seems decreasing, and loses the interest of the public.

For instance, art such as scenery, forest and waterfall pictures promote the tranquillity of the human mind. Consequently, the employer should provide family days for their employees by letting them visit  the art galleries to relax their minds. Additionally, the government should support the artists by providing affordable rental prices or free-of-charge function halls to showcase their artworks. For example, in Singapore,  artwork shows are allowed free of charge at the shopping mall function place so that the artists can able to closely get in touch with the locals to promote their artwork skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people are busy and struggling for their living resulting the fewer visitors to  art galleries.

As a result, the lucrative field of that company will not have the best consequence due to the lack of staff and their limited range of work.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, money is not the priority of everything and social responsibilities are needed for each participant, none of these corporations should prioritize the importance of cash. Hence, this essay has given evidence to clarify the opinion."}

Why might this be the case? Do you think this a positive or negative situation?", "content": "The importance of welfare is irrefutable throughout society. Dwellers would tend to have a personal accommodation rather than the rent which could bring some drawbacks such as physical efforts, restrictions to renovation, and financial loss. I completely agree with this attitude and in this essay, I will elaborate on the merits of this approach.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the predominant reason for this tendency is that they have to implement the landlord\u2019s stringent laws which restrict the freedom of folk, and they cannot renovate the house with their taste. For instance, my friend does not have permission to have pets such as a dog or cat. Furthermore, another reason for growing this willingness is moving to another place needs physical effort and is time-consuming. For example, they are tortured by packing and transferring their furniture to another house. Moreover, residents may have fewer opportunities to save financially. A good illustration of this is they have to allocate a part of their money to a landlord instead of saving it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I strongly believe that home ownership has many positive consequences. This attitude causes a push to work harder to own a mansion. If there is more satisfaction to have an abode, they would have fewer intentions to make money and they get rid of those problems that arise from being tenants.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, buying an own land is so beneficial, because it gives a sense of satisfaction, fulfilment, and comfortable. Also, this conspicuous trend would not bring any drawbacks in people\u2019s lives."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?", "content": "People have different views with regard to whether shops can continue to sell food and beverage which was proven to be detrimental to human beings\u2019 fitness. While some may argue that governments should come up with measures to restrict merchants, I agree with the statement that it should not be banned.\r\n\r\nAlthough junk foods are always appealing to most people, I am no exception, it may give rise to burdens on the medical system. So serious that the detrimental food, including KFC, and McDonald, leads to physical health problems and chronic illness. According to the research from Cambridge, the more fried foods you ingest, the higher rate you may suffer from cancer as well as chronic diseases in older lives. Therefore, it is obvious that unhealthy food is able to worsen people\u2019s physical health and result in a burden on the nation\u2019s medical system. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, in my perspective, we cannot ignore the importance of unhealthy food in particular conditions. Firstly, unhealthy food may be a kind of life necessary for a particular group. As we know, in some countries, such as most eastern countries, unhealthy food may be the cheapest option that the disadvantaged group could afford it. If the government enacts rules restricting its production, it may endanger the poor public who struggle to make ends meets in life. Secondly, in a democratic country, I suggest that people possess their own right to choose what foods they are eager to taste. In particular, some crowds gain happiness from consuming unhealthy food and beverage, such as Cola and fried chicken. Furthermore, everyone can assess their own fitness condition to decide whether they can eat unhealthy foods. As a result, I consider that it should let the market freely develop without interference.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that unhealthy may cause detrimental problems for human beings and the medical system as well, I agree that those should not be banned seeing that some particular groups and peers may be in need of such food and drinks."}

Thus, some people suppose that it is essential to read and understand the writings of their nation country, while another group of individuals believe that studying literature from all over the world is extremely important. I think that a knowledge of huge different kinds of compositions from different countries has a great impact on our life. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, poetry and prose from our own country help young people to dive into the world of historical values and traditions of their country and deeply understand different events in the past. Knowing the history of their own country, individuals are able to prevent the same mistakes in the present. For instance, knowledge about some problems with the export of different types of products in the past could help with selling these goods nowadays. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if students are taught international writing, they become more culturally aware, which is crucial nowadays. Understanding a system of moral values and national traditions of different countries has immense benefits for all individuals, like visiting a large number of countries, having an international business and working at international companies. Besides, reading foreign literature can broaden our horizons and make people more intelligent and creative. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe that a knowledge of a wide range of writings is vital for all individuals due to the fact that people are becoming more culturally aware and intelligent. Moreover, international study, work and business require an understanding of the traditions of this country."}

I disagree with the statement that English should be the main language taught in all schools around the world. It is said that our country has a mother tongue. In this article, I will present both perspectives in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it has been observed that English is spoken by millions of people around the world. There are numerous news channels, sports commentaries, and advertisements in English. People should always learn English as their first language because it can be helpful in various ways. For example, if a Spaniard travels to the United States and does not know English, they may face many hurdles such as asking for directions to a hotel or buying anything from a local store. Also, if we plan on studying abroad in Canada, the USA, Australia or the UK, our English skills must be impeccable since those countries' primary language is English. Therefore, it is said that English should be one of the main languages taught in every school.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people believe that learning English is a waste of time because we cannot use it in any form. Many countries, including Germany, Spain, Japan, and China, do not speak English as their first language. Because these countries communicate in their own languages for business purposes. Moreover, German, Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese are only spoken in their respective countries. For example, if we have a Chinese client who hands over their business to an Indian person, it can be challenging for the Indian to communicate in Chinese. Therefore, they do not learn English as their first language because children may confuse it with their mother tongue.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I suggest that English should not be the only language taught in every school, but schools must take the initiative to teach basic English. Therefore, any child should not have difficulty travelling to any other English-speaking country in the future."}

It seems to me that philanthropy should not be forced on everybody, and I will explain why in this essay. \r\n\r\nFirstly, everybody has different financial circumstances as well as priorities, which restricts their budget to their own needs and desires. This includes utilities that they should pay monthly, such as electricity, water supply, groceries, and insurance; and even if they have excess money left, some people will spend it for their leisure. A second negative factor is that individuals find it difficult to trust some charities because of scam histories. This happens when there are philanthropical facilities that take advantage of people and take away the donation fees for themselves, which created a notorious image for such institutions. This leads us to the final, and perhaps most significant drawback to philanthropic actions, which is the pressure they put on individuals to fund families who are in need. By ,this we mean that if individuals feel forced and responsible to provide part of their income, otherwise they will be labelled as soulless people. \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, there are some positives to benefaction, most notably the number of adults and children who may experience stuff that they have never had before, such as books, toys, proper clothing, food, etc. Nevertheless, it seems that for many humans, these things are outweighed by issues which can cause stress and economic burden to them. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, the problems of financial concerns, assurance, and feeling obliged combine together to make donating challenging and potentially difficult responsibility for many, especially when they have their priorities. This is not to say that all should not give their portion of income, but it is important to do it on their own accord."}

This essay will discuss the main  issues associated with this habit, and propose a possible solution . \r\n\r\n   The main problems caused by not getting enough sleep are the lack of motivation and the absence of patience. If individuals are tired, they will not be able to perform at their maximum capacity and will struggle to complete the hard actions .They will not have the energy to complete the tasks from their to-do list and this could have a bad influence on their workplace. For example, if a man got only 4 hours of sleep ,and at work he did only one important task out of ten , he can get fired.  Additionally, fewer hours of sleep can lead to impatience and anger, and the constant feeling of stress. For instance, if I get only  120 minutes of sleep, the next day I don't have patience and I get mad at everything.\r\n\r\n    In my opinion, the best solution to this problem is to make a sleep schedule. If individuals monitor the hour when they went  to bed and the hour they woke up, they will be more careful with their program. Furthermore,  once they start paying attention to the connexion between their behaviour and the hour they had  gone to bed, they will want to get more sleeping time daily. So, a  watch that monitors their sleep may be a helpful tool.\r\n\r\n   In conclusion, not getting enough sleep can lead to not only  a lack of patience  but also difficulties at work . The most effective solution is tracking the sleeping time with a watch."}

In my view, this statement has both pros and cons, and the following expository paragraphs will expatiate both stances with lucid examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in contemporary society, in which all people are using smart gadgets such as a notebook, a computer, and so on, it has been scientifically proven that individuals have been spending almost all their time on intelligent devices, which assists them to work from  places that they want. For instance, according to research, approximately 60 per cent of occupations are possible to give a chance to their staff that work from remote areas such as provinces, countryside, etc. Furthermore, it has some advantages, for example, those workers who work from home say that it is not only more comfortable than working in an office but also increases productivity, and job satisfaction. Therefore, the majority of people will work from their homes in the future.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in many highly developed countries like Japan, those employees have proven that it is less stressful and gives you valuable time to spend with families. A study shows that during the coronavirus pandemic, many workers' efficiency was increased compared to in the past time. Considering that, if we all work from our homes, the unprecedented result will come to our society. In addition, many experts say that ten or fifteen years from now, all the things that are based on technology will enhance more than in the present.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that people tend to prefer working from their homes because it is more flexible than doing a job from an office."}

From my perspective, I strongly dissent from this perspective as it also facilitates the acquisition of new customers, enhances the level of competition, and disseminates information to society regarding the company's social initiatives.\r\n\r\nOne compelling justification for my perspective is that advertising plays a pivotal role in enabling companies to expand their market share. Advertisements play a crucial role in enhancing the visibility and perception of products or services, thereby increasing consumer awareness. It is important to note that the high quality of a product does not automatically result in widespread consumer awareness throughout the entire market. For example, a bakery specializing in the sale of delectable banh mi sandwiches may primarily enjoy a reputation among its local clientele. However, through the utilization of social network advertising, it has the potential to draw the attention of discerning food enthusiasts from various parts of the city.\r\n\r\nOne additional rationale for my dissent is that advertising significantly contributes to market competition. This phenomenon can be attributed to the inherent tendency of individuals to consistently pursue superior options for consumption. Due to this rationale, comprehensive advertising campaigns possess the ability to educate consumers about the offerings of a particular business and allure them towards transitioning their brand preferences. An additional explanation for my dissent lies in the utilization of advertising as a means to disseminate the social endeavours undertaken by corporations. In order to contribute to the betterment of society, individuals are encouraged to engage in the purchase of goods and services from companies that are recognized for their commitment to social responsibility. Vinmart, a prominent agency, experienced a notable increase in customer footfall in the subsequent months following a marketing campaign that publicized its initiative to offer red meals to underprivileged individuals amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\n\r\nIn summary, there is a prevalent belief that advertising is superfluous when the quality of a product is deemed satisfactory. I vehemently disagree with this proposition due to the fact that advertising fulfils important objectives such as augmenting market share, facilitating competition with rival brands, and bolstering sales by informing the public about the enterprise's social initiatives. I would like to propose that companies consistently incorporate advertising initiatives into their commercial pursuits, irrespective of the exceptional quality of their products."}

The reason for this problem will be explained in the following article, and I believe there are some practical solutions to fix it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are several reasons why people gain weight. First and foremost, unhealthy eating is caused by various reasons such as long working hours and the high cost of preparing healthy food. In other words, since people now work more than 8 hours a day, they do not have extra time to cook at home and therefore do not eat homemade food. Additionally, healthy meals can be costly in certain countries as not everyone is able to afford them. Therefore, they prefer to eat cheap junk food. Additionally, nowadays, due to changes in people's preferences, the amount of exercise is decreasing. For example, they tend to commute by car instead of walking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, both governments and individuals can solve this problem. For example, countries can impose a tax on junk food to decrease its consumption. Additionally, it can also subsidize the cost of healthy food. In addition, individuals should try making lifestyle changes to maintain physical fitness in different ways, such as incorporating walking into their daily routine, to compensate for the lack of adequate exercise.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the increase in society's average weight results in a decrease in their health and fitness levels. In my opinion, increasing taxes on junk food, providing more subsidies for healthy foods, and promoting individual lifestyle changes can be considered  solutions to this issue."}

Do you think this is a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.", "content": "In this day and age, where the public tends to be more dependent on technology when a community encounters difficulties, they tend to conduct research before seeking professional advice. When encountering a disease, countries will also conduct research and gather opinions from people before visiting the clinic or hospital. From my personal understanding, I believe that seeking advice from professionals is more important than conducting research and gathering opinions from one's society. In the following paragraphs, I will delve deeper into this topic and illustrate my point with examples.\r\n\r\nFirstly, when we rely on unprofessional advice, we risk falling prey to scammers who can exploit our vulnerability. For example, if people thought we might have some lung problems, they would introduce us to unauthorized supplements and make money off of them. Similarly, if the supplement is combined with certain prohibited minerals. This could potentially affect our strengths even more.\r\n\r\nSecondly, although some health issues can be treated, due to the extended period required for alternative remedies, there is a risk that we may miss out on opportunities for recovery. For example, we can see from this pandemic that if we do not treat it in time, the virus in our body can eat away our entire lungs. Many communities will also die at home due to infection. This worry has seriously affected our health, and if we do not receive professional counselling soon, we may lose the ability to fight the virus.\r\n\r\nAll in all, society should be more aware of its own well-being and should seek professional advice before exploring other treatments. I reiterate my opinion that as humans, we should be more cautious about our own health concerns and seek professional guidance before making any decisions."}

For many people, this perspective permits the coexistence of various customs within a nation's borders. Therefore, this article will discuss the arguments from both perspectives. In my opinion, tourists should follow the national laws and regulations of the host country.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the most important preventive reason for preserving local cultures is to learn new things and avoid life-threatening threats. This is because the new civilization allows tourists to come into contact with a specific local environment in their lives, leading them to integrate with that environment. Secondly, tourists are often unaware of local crime rates and how to take necessary security measures. Therefore, the distinction between them and locals is clearly visible in their appearance but can be easily stripped away at any time. For example, Pakistani newlyweds who visited the US went their separate ways, but one of them had his/her cell phone snatched near Trump Tower. Therefore, following local customs may surprise tourists.\r\n\r\nHowever, it has become a cultural phenomenon that provides traditional freedom and drives the economy. Firstly, the cultural configuration guides tourists to feel at ease and stylish while introducing them to the local way of life. Additionally, it enhances the foreign language skills of the locals. For example, UAE citizens travelling to Pakistan can educate the local people about their food, dress, and cultural ways. Additionally, allowing one's own civilization path can attract and boost tourism, which will open trade routes, bring in foreign exchange, and develop tourism. Therefore, independent traditions may be of interest to foreigners and attract tourists.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, following a local style can have an impact on locals but also poses health risks. Promoting one's own culture may increase the interest of tourists and the country. I am a firm believer that tourists should obey the rules of the country they are visiting."}

Initially, the hunting of hunters aims at some rare ingredients, for instance, the horns of the rhinos are believed to be fairy medicine, or they can be luxury decorations in some wealthy families. In addition, the population of this animal has a significant decrease during the 19th century and is nearly extinct nowadays. Moreover, biological weapons are a factor in the death of many kinds of animals and plants, which make the world less diverse in the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are more important nature issues that directly affect to the human-being. First and foremost, climate change makes the earth hotter and hotter over time. This can lead to many different effects, a case in point is the ice melting in the Antarctic and the Arctic, as a result, many cities and lands are forecast to be drowned under the seawater next decade, furthermore, by increasing the temperature, many forests are burning which lead to the lack of oxygen. Moreover, due to the waste of carbon dioxide passing the limit, the ozone layer is getting more and more damage, which is the cause of many skin diseases.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I do believe that the loss of animals and plants is one of the environmental problems, however, there are many more issues that we have to cope with, such as climate change and the dramatically increasing in carbon dioxide that discharge into the environment."}

What can be done to reduce this gap?", "content": "The disparity in financial circumstances between the rich and the poor grows wider by the day, resulting in an economic gap. In this particular essay, the cause of this issue as well as the solution to decrease the gap will be discussed.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the economic gap that happens in a country can lead to the inaccessibility of education. In general, only wealthy people can get access to  good quality education. It is because of the funds needed to get a good quality education. Therefore, poor people commonly have difficulty in receiving a good quality education due to limited funds. They prefer to use their money to fulfil their lives. According to this, unprivileged people usually hard to get a job because of the minimum competencies that they have. They lack enough money to fulfil their lives. Hence, needy people tend to do criminal activities to get a better life. This event will affect  the risen crime rates in that country.\r\n\r\nAs a response to solving this issue. Governments need to give  good quality education facilities to poor people. For example, governments build a school with free entrance fees and without monthly fees. It will give an opportunity for all needy people to gain a better quality of life through education. Likewise, it can reduce the crime rates because they will get a job since their competencies have been increased from a education. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the economic gap is leading to increased crime rates due to the limited access to education for poor people. To address this issue, the government needs to build an education facility of good quality for unprivileged people."}

Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime , and the motivation for commiting it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.", "content": "The allocation of punishment for criminals has been a highly debated topic. Many intellectuals are in favour of fixed sentences for different crimes, while others believe that judicial systems should take into account all the elements of a crime and sentence accordingly. This article presents both perspectives and elaborates on mine.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the previous perspective places significant importance on pre-determined sentences for different criminal offences. This optimistic view is leading to a lack of diversity in punishments. As a result, the time-consuming judicial system will become more efficient, and the crime rate will be suppressed to a great extent. For example, fixed penalties can help create a fair work environment, which would boost public trust in the law. Therefore, by implementing a common policy for all criminals, the crime rate will decrease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the latter view paints a picture of the flexibility of the legislative system for various crimes. This view focuses more on the seriousness of the crime, and therefore, the criminal should be punished. In addition, the circumstances and motives of the crime scene are also considered in the judgment. Although this type of jurisdiction is time-consuming, it can save innocent people. For example, a murder and an intentional assassination committed by a person in self-defence require different perspectives and punishments. Therefore, dynamic laws can effectively mitigate potential crimes.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the sentence regarding criminal activity has a significant impact on criminal behaviour. In my opinion, the dynamic characteristics of the jurisdiction are more favourable for society to effectively curb criminal activity."}

Thus, it has brought many pluses. Every single individual can access the nearest and dearest whenever he wants, and it helps us to communicate simply, and be in touch with each other. For example, in the past times, it took several months to ask someone whether they are in a good condition or not. However, it has decreased to a few seconds these days. In addition, the whole nation can benefit from these items. Companies can solve their work matters 24/7 because all of the employees are accessible. Therefore, advantages are not limited to just every individual. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we should not neglect the drawbacks. Technologies, including have kept us far from each other in some ways. For example, face-to-face interactions have become restricted, and we all use social media or the like to contact each other. Therefore, we have become strangers rather than friends. Moreover, using smartphones in  public can disturb others. So, this is the negative effect which we have to consider. For instance, while commuting there are a lot of people on the bus, and talking loudly in these places can harm others. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, smartphones have brought many advantages, but we have to consider the negative aspects. It helps us to keep in touch and develops communication. On the other side, it has weakened bonds and also has some drawbacks when it is used in public."}

Personally, I completely agree with the idea that it is likely to encounter some serious trouble when you can not speak the native language, and I am going to consider below two arguments to support my position.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the main reason is that people are not familiar with the language, culture and customs when they migrate to a new place where people speak other languages. This means it is highly possible that they may not communicate naturally and fluently with their classmates, colleagues and neighbours as they have different languages, backgrounds and experiences. In addition, using improper and impolite words could make others puzzled and misunderstand when they talk to others, which negatively impacts socialization and making friends. For instance, when their friends are sharing views about history and politics, it is quite hard for someone without that field\u2019s knowledge and vocabulary to get involved. In turn, they are more likely to be isolated, which is not beneficial for their mentalities and mindsets. \r\n\r\nThe second reason is that they are unknown policies or official processes, which also could result in some difficult problems. Dealing with daily issues is a vital part of people\u2019s daily life, and living abroad make this more difficult, which in turn could cause some serious practical troubles. For example, if they are not clear about the process to apply for a visa or society insurance, it is likely to be rejected or complicate the process, which could involve some extra trouble in their daily life. \r\n\r\nConsequently, I fundamentally agree that some people could encounter some unexpectedly serious problems when they migrate to a country where they are unfamiliar with the language. However, despite the fact that it is challenging, moving to another country could be a fantastic experience for them."}

They say that the only way to increase recycling is for governments to make it a legal requirement. To what do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?", "content": "During the contemporary era, preserving the environment is one of the key issues which seriously challenges our society. Any environmental can raise an argument, and we are facing one problem which is recycling household waste. Some people believe that the only way to boost recycling depends on legal requirements from the authorities. In this essay, I will discuss my agreement on imposing laws for household waste recycling. \r\n\r\nFirstly, taking Singapore a sound example of a thriving country with minimal street rubbish and household pollutants. In fact, they impose a certain number of regulations for waste, especially household waste. For instance, Singaporean residents or even visitors can be fined 2000 dollars per household if they tend to not categorize their family waste or not recycle bottles/food into certain bins. \r\n\r\nSecondly, one of the advantageous aspects of imposing laws is to enforce the importance of protecting the environment, recycling in particular. Most Asian people, for instance, seem to be indifferent to daily activities if those are not required by legislation. However, the necessity of the government is not only about punishments, but it is also related to setting some motivations for people and changing their mindsets based on a variety of weekly regulations or mandatory activities such as public recycling days, a bottle of litter, and so on. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the escalating volume of ordinary waste poses a significant concern for our society. To address this issue, implementing recycling laws by governments emerges as an ideal solution. By drawing inspiration from successful models like Singapore and combining it with strategies to promote positive behavior change, we can ease the burden of waste on our environment."}

To what do you think laws are needed to make people recycle more of their waste?", "content": "Some individuals opine that only a few of the garbage from the residence area is reused. They argued that a strict rule obliged by the government can only be changed this trend. I strongly agree with this opinion. This essay will elaborate on the viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the State should start a campaign to spread awareness from time to time. People usually forget or avoid regulations that were developed years ago. They normally get involved in their daily life. So, these campaigns will definitely help to improve this problem. Moreover, education that is based on environmental factors should start from high school. This will not only help to educate youth but also they will get used to it. For instance,in  a survey that was conducted in 2010, Singapore was the world's best clean and green country. Institutes in Singapore are mend rule that classes related to nature health are compulsory. Thus, adopting some changes will improve people's minds.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the regime should involve offenders to do volunteer work in the form of sorting waste. This could be the punishment as well. People who usually indulge in criminal activities are the most who unfollow rules and regulations. Therefore, they will learn how to clean the city while dealing with the prison. To exemplify, there are thousands of prisoners who committed minor crimes, the government can set up some volunteer work for offenders to sort the waste out. This step will improve both humanity as well as the environment.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, with the help of some positive changes, issues related to waste will surely get resolved. This can also be predicted that awareness of waste material will spread all over the world."}

Due to this, a section of the public believe that the effective way to boost reusing finished product is that, officials should enforce laws. I strongly concur that rules and regulations will put fear in the general public and can also motivate them.\r\n\r\n      To begin with, when the state makes laws, humanity will panic and this will force them to recycle most of their used products. For example, Ghana was named a pollutant country a decade ago because of the poor recycling of items. However, after the government set rules, the vast majority of Ghanaian citizens adopted reprocessing old goods. This means that human being changes their attitude when a law is strictly imposed.Therefore, there is no doubt that punishment put fear in people  to change their characters.\r\n\r\n        In addition, when rules are established, the populace will be motivated to recreate old materials. For instance, research conducted by the United States of America revealed that sixty-four per cent of people become motivated when working under regulations. In fact, citizens experience a high level of spirit to reprocess obsolete products. This does not mitigate pollution but also curbed ecological hindrances.\r\n\r\n            In conclusion, a significant number of people feel reluctant to recycle outdated materials. However, when officials enforced laws, this phenomenon can be ceased because it  can cause panic as well as motivation to the general public."}

Discuss both views and give your opinion", "content": "In this day and age, education has been improving exceedingly, offering more and more opportunities for students to unlock. However, there are claims suggesting that there should be distinct classes where gifted students can study on their own whereas others argue that all learners should learn in the same classroom. This essay will discuss both views as well as give out my own perspective. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, it is true that when talented pupils get to have their own teachers and mentors, they can grow and flourish their skills more easily as they are learning on their own level while other students are learning on theirs. For instance, pupils who are more advanced in Math will be able to learn more complex equations in the gifted classrooms and develop their gift instead of studying at a much easier level that doesn\u2019t help with their skill. Moreover, it would be much easier for educators to assist students who are in need of help and support instead of just concentrating on or ignoring the brilliant learners. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, doing this may result in separation and labels around school, making talented kids in better classes more superior and may result in bullying and a lack of morals in students. In Addition, these levels and classes may not be accurate to a learner\u2019s actual performance, as there are certain teenagers who are content with their current class and would not like to put effort to excel. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite the said positives of this issue, there are a lot of downsides that should be taken into consideration. In my point of view, it is vastly more advantageous to teach everyone in an equal manner and not divide them into different classes as it would help the child have more competition and gain more opportunities to grow."}
