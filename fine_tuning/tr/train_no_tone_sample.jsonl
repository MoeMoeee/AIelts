{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries, smoking is now illegal in public places. Many people believe that such a ban is justified. \nDo you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Smoking has been banned in public places like parks, hospitals, public transport and restaurants in many nations. This essay agrees with this initiative because it reduces the harmful effects of passive smoking and also encourages smokers to quit. \n\nThe primary reason why making it illegal to smoke in public makes sense is preventing people from having to breathe in second-handsmoke. Passive smoking can lead to many smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease and stroke, and is something that non-smokers cannot avoid in the presence of a smoker. The British Medical Association found that non-smokers who were regularly exposed to tobacco smoke were 4 times more likely to develop lung cancer, than those who did not have to breathe in second-hand smoke.\n\nThe second main reason is that this ban helps those addicted to cigarettes quit their habit. When smokers and non-smokers socialize together, the smokers are often ostracised from the group because they have to leave the company of everyone else if they want to light up. As a result, smokers who decided to quit would feel more a part of the social gatherings they attend, and this should encourage people who smoke to give it up. This has proven particularly effective in Ireland, the first country to introduce a nationwide ban, where people have to leave a bar or restaurant and smoke outside.\n\nIn conclusion, making it against the law to smoke around strangers should be encouraged because it prevents innocent people from dying of passive smoking and reduces the number of smokers.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, toi nhan thay rang ban da tra loi day du cau hoi trong de bai bang cach dua ra ly do tai sao nen cam hut thuoc o noi cong cong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some say that music, art and drama are as important as other school subjects, especially at the primary level. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Some people believe that arts-related subjects are as important as other school subjects, especially for primary school children. I totally agree with this statement because this can help children to discover their talents from an early age and can increase their confidence. \nOne of the reasons I agree that creative subjects have the same importance as other school courses in primary school is that it allows students to find out their potential talents early on. That is to say, school-age is the most convenient time for students to learn more about their interests by trying different activities as they are young enough to pursue their hobbies. They will probably not have any other chance later in their lives to discover that because they will be busy with difficult exams when they get older. For example, most famous singers were discovered by their music teachers at school from a young age, and they claimed that they could not be that successful if their teachers did not find out their talents when they were young.\nMoreover, music, art and drama subjects help students to boost their confidence. That is because creative lessons teach students how to perform in front of lots of people and give them a chance to socialise with other students. As a result, students can realise their real potential and act more confidently. For instance, many psychologists suggest to students who are struggling with social anxiety to take drama lessons as it helps to enhance confidence. \nIn conclusion, this essay completely agrees that music, art and drama have the same value as other subjects in primary school because it allows children to discover their hidden talents early on and increases their self-confidence.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach dong y rang cac mon nghe thuat co y nghia tuong duong voi cac mon hoc khac o cap tieu hoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Multinational companies are becoming increasingly common in developing countries. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is becoming more popular in developing nations to see multinational corporations. There are some benefits for this trend such as the progress in the economy they create in these countries and the availability of jobs, however, the shut down of some small local businesses and the lower selling rate of local products can be its drawbacks.\n\nThe main advantage of the increasing number of these types of companies is the economic progress. That is to say, if multinational organizations operate in less-developed nations, this can bring wealth which boosts industries, trade, and other aspects of the economy. Moreover, more jobs will be available for the local people. That is because more workers and managers are needed to work for these companies which can be a good opportunity for locals to find a job. For instance, after opening a branch of Apple company in Dubai, many local graduates were thrilled by the good news of being accepted to work under this renowned company. \n\nHowever, one of the main disadvantages of this trend is the drop in the selling rate of the local products. That is because of the good reputations and qualities of international items, and, thus, citizens might refrain from buying their local products. Another disadvantage is that some small local shops could be closed. That is due to the unfair competition with these huge strong establishments, and as a result, some might be shut down or go bankrupt. For example, many amateur Syrian entrepreneurs, and after the harsh competition they had with international textile corporation, were forced to close their fabric factories. \n\nIn conclusion, although the advantages of the popularity of multinational organizations in developing countries are the economic progress and the improvement in the job market, nonetheless, its downsides are the drop in the average selling of local products and the closure of some small businesses.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ro cac loi ich va han che cua cac cong ty da quoc gia trong cac nuoc dang phat trien.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that allowing children to male their own choices on everyday matters(such as food, clothes and entertainment) is likely to result in a society of individuals who only think about their own wishes. Other people believe that it is important for children to make decisions about matters that affect them. Discuss both views and give your own opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Many people think that parents should allow their children make daily decisions, but others are concerned that doing so can raise self-serving individuals. Personally, I believe that we should let them make the decision.\n\nOn the one hand, children grew by extremely strict parents tend to be social introverts. They had to obey all of their parents' rules as children, regardless of what they wanted to do. For instance, they might be particularly skilled in gaming or working with technology. However, their parents want them to become physicians or engineers. Since they are unable to pursue their own interests, they develop a lack of ambition. Therefore, it is crucial to allow kids make decisions or think about what they want to do from an early age.\n\nOn the other side, individuals who grew up with their parents in relatively open relationships frequently lack empathy for others. This occurs because they always received from their guardian what they want and did not have to consider if it was right or wrong. It is their parents' fault, not their own. Elders should teach kids whether or not they are being sensible so that they understand that things don't always go the way they do in movies. Because of this, it is also crucial to manage some of their early emotions.\n\nMy parents educated me and instilled in me the value of considering all possibilities and their effects before acting. Today, I developed into a person who can express my needs to others while also knowing what I really desire. Therefore, I think it is the parents' primary responsibility to always make sure their children are on the right track.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDay la danh gia chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many manufactured food and drink products contain high levels of sugars which causes many health problems. Sugary products should be made more expensive to encourage people to consume less sugar.\"\nEssay:\n\"Food preferences of humans are changing over time. As per this evolution,  products containing an enormous level of glucose content is becoming famous and they can be the root cause of many diseases. However, drinks and foods of this sort can be discouraged by people through awareness as increasing the price is not the only ideal solution.\n\nOn the one hand, if  sugary consumables are expensive, most individuals will hesitate to buy them. Eventually, the market for such products will go down. For instance, if  Coca-Cola becomes expensive and there is no other cheap alternative, society will tend not to buy it considering the price. Consequently, this will lead to a healthier pocket-friendly lifestyle.\n\n The cost elevation is a practical solution to this problem but there are other most convenient and feasible ways as well.\n\nOn the other hand, the price surge is not the only solution. Humans have to be made aware of the adverse consequences for the body which are caused by the intake of excessive sweets. In supermarkets, for example, there can be campaigns to alert people about the diseases like diabetes which has now increased over the years. Certainly, if people will know the bad effects of such drinks, they will step back.\n\nMoreover, buyers need to be made aware of alternative choices which are healthier and sweet like fruits.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve viec tang gia cac san pham co nong do duong cao nham khuyen khich moi nguoi tieu thu it duong hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Today’s schools should teach their students how to survive financially in the world today. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\"\nEssay:\n\"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is teaching students how to be financially competent in the world. Now people are beginning to realize that schools need to add such clasess where children will be taught how to handle money. Personally, I tend to think think that it is a great opportunity for kids to become more informed and even succesfull. \n\nFirstly, it is well known that it is more convenient to teach people financial literacy from an early age because they convey information very easily. What I mean here is that they will know the value for funds and will be more accurate when purchasing something. One of the main reasons behind that is those kids will never complain about the lack of money because they had already broadened their horizons and know how to deal with distinct financial difficulties. A good case in point is children will be able to handle a salary for expensive things such as houses or cars which is the goal of every adult. \n\nOn the other hand, it can also be argued that only this kind of lesson should be educated at schools. That is to say teachers should pay a lot of attention to other subjects because students have to obtain proper education not only how to be skilled at funding. Take for example, there are a wide range of kids who may not be interested in finance, so it is crucial to consider that fact and not to focus on only one aspect. \n\nIn conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account we can say that there are both pros and cons to this purpose, however, it would not be superfluous in the lives of young people, it can only provide the best future\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDe danh gia Task Response cua bai viet cua ban mot cach chi tiet hon, duoi day la nhan xet:\n\nBai viet cua ban dong y voi quan diem rang ngay nay, truong hoc nen day hoc sinh cach song ve tai chinh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Humanity has always been experimenting with different technologies to make sales perform better. In recent years, online shopping websites and apps have become quite popular, which makes some individuals think that they can close down offline shops. In my opinion this claim is overstated and it is not going to happen in the near future. However, online services may be more preferable for certain people.\n\nOn the one hand, offline shops afford people the opportunity to make more deliberate and weighed decisions on items to buy. This is especially the case for clothes, as it is much more convenient to try on them immediately in a fitting room. Another significant benefit of offline shops is that a person can ask for a consultation from a seller. This is crucial for older individuals, who need extra guidance and assistance during their shopping. For instance, my grandparents are not advanced users of the internet, therefore they always choose to see products they want to buy with their own eyes.\n\nOn the other hand, online services have developed substantially over the recent years. They are constantly looking for new opportunities to make their apps and websites convenient to as many users as possible. The reason for that is the advanced improvement of internet technologies, which allows them to experiment with different styles of user interface to find the ones that perform better for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of individuals use online services because of their convenience. However, there will always be people who find them difficult to use or simply enjoy the offline shopping experience. This is the reason why offline shops are going to coexist with online apps and websites making shopping available for all the people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent times we have had an increase in online shopping and certain individuals believe it will lead to the closure of shops in towns and cities. Although we have reasons to agree with this, I disagree with this notion and in this essay, I will state my reasons.\n\nFirstly, online shopping has been helpful to a lot of people especially the working class who have limited time to visit the market. With this, they are able to stay in the comfort of their homes or office and place an order for most items on a website. Secondly, for items manufactured in a location far from the buyer, they can be ordered online and shipped to them. For example, we have goods produced in China or in Vietnam and they are displayed on a particular website and then can be purchased and shipped to the buyer's location in Nigeria.\n\nOn the other hand, we have a lot of fashion items that are better off bought in a physical store. Personally, I have purchased dresses and shoes online which were sent to me and were not my size. For example, I purchased a dress online in a large size but it was delivered as a medium-sized dress. As a result, I had to return the dress and incurred extra costs for shipping. Also, I bought a footwear on a website and it was delivered two sizes smaller than my size. This in turn can also lead to me wasting money as I end up giving the item out or I have to wait for so long to get it replaced. Another issue is with household utensils and perishable goods. Purchasing these items online is not favourable as they might get to the buyer damaged and in terrible conditions in the process of delivering the item. For example, an individual decides to order foodstuffs like tomatoes or glassware like mugs and plates online. In most cases, the tomatoes are delivered rotten, while the mugs and plates are delivered broken as a result of carelessness by the delivery man which can be avoided if an individual goes to personally purchase the items.\n\nIn conclusion, although online shopping is a great medium for obtaining goods and services, it can never lead to the closure of all stores in towns and cities as individuals avoid getting items they cannot use as a result of the wrong size and will have the luxury to pick from various design and check different stores.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.\n\nDiscuss both sides and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In today's world there are two opinions about whether or not it is beneficial to get a higher education at universities. Some tend to think that doing a degree is the best way to be a high-paid employee, whereas others' opinion is that hands-on learning and people skills are more essential. I will discuss both of these views and express my opinion .\n\nThere are groups of people who think that it is necessary to finish a university because without educational background there are fewer chances to get a good profession. University education provides a lot of courses that will teach students about important skills that will help them in their future job. On top of that, teachers are subject specialists and have excellent experiences which can be helpful for their learners. Therefore, some people think that completing a university education is a thing that should be done by students anyway.\n\nTurning to the other side of the argument, others' view is that experience and soft skills are more pivotal than education at the university. The reason is that sometimes students can have a good education, but they do not know, for example, how to behave with people politely, they do not have an experience in answering correctly in different situations, such as when a customer does not like the thing that he has bought and get angry. Thus, people think that is more pivotal to get experience rather than education.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that I tend to think that it is necessary for everyone to get a higher education because it provides a wide selection of opportunities for students.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da de cap den ca hai mat cua cuoc tranh luan (hoan thanh giao duc dai hoc so voi co kinh nghiem va ky nang mem) va cho biet quan diem rieng cua minh.

This essay intends to discuss the importancde of sport in anyones life.\n\nThere are myriad advantages of sports curriculm as they significantly effect the health of human beings.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The governments investment in art such as music and theatre is a waste of money, government must invest money on public service instead. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"The Authorities Investing in art is a normal and old way business in which the government invest more in public services but, recently public demand has become more essential than art.Therefore, I will agree that the authorities should divert the money to invest in public demand such as the construction of good Roads and the provision of good water supply being more important than craft.This shall be expatriates in the essay.\n\nThe Authorities should spend more money on social needs such as roads than art because not everyone loves art despite the fact that it has its own health benefits but having good roads superseded it. For ,example when one is sick and needs to access health care on time with good roads, Heath care services will be rendered without any complications But when the roads are bad the person's condition will  become worst along the journey and death might occur.\n\nIn addition to the above, governments should invest more in providing a good water supply.As we all know that water is a major requirement for man to survive on Earth, after getting access to water if, the water consumed is unhygienic it will jeopardize the person's health. Good drink results in a good community and state. For instance, when people are always getting sick due to the consumption of unhygienic drinks, the governments will not have peace of mind, and money will be wasted on drugs instead of achievements in well-being.moreso if care is not taken life will be lost.\n\nConclusively, in contrast to the Government's investment in the craft such as music and theatre rather than public service, I will agree that money should be diverted to public services like the construction of good roads and the provision of good water that will help to have a good developing environment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"These days, people work in more than one job, and often change career several times during their life. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?\"\nEssay:\n\"People often tended to have a fixed job that could last for their lifetime in the past, but it is changed now. For many individuals, job change has been their purpose in life nowadays. In this essay, I will outline what I consider to be some positive and negative parts of this trend.\n\nCertainly, there are several key benefits stemming from changing jobs frequently. One of them is to gain more experience in a different environment. In one company, for example, the longer an employee works, the more routined tasks are. Thus, moving to a new organisation can allow the worker to learn a different thing. Another key benefit is that people may get higher pay in a new job. It is reported that the pay may rise up to 30% for those who choose to move on with a new entity, while, in contrast, it is only 10% for a regular annual salary increment. Clearly, changing jobs is very attractive. \n\nHowever, it does have its limitations. Job-hopping can be difficult because people need to start afresh. They need to go through a probation period many times, learning the basics and gradually involving in an important project if a manager believes in their abilities and values. I myself, for instance, took 2 years to understand and master a new career but finally quit to return to the previous company due to stress. In addition to this difficulty, the person may end up unemployed if they fail to pass the probation or if they cannot get along with their new colleagues. If they cannot find a new job to continue, it ultimately creates a financial issue as well. \n\nIn conclusion, having a job changed is a choice of each person for their future career and better life. If anyone decides to move on with a new career, it is better for them to take some time to consider all potential problems and be well-prepared to overcome them.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve uu va nhuoc diem cua viec lam nhieu cong viec va thay doi su nghiep nhieu lan trong cuoc song.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people feel supermarkets and manufacturers have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"A highly controversial issue today relates to whether industries or consumers should be responsible for the reduction in over wrapping of products displayed in stores. This essay will discuss both arguments and explain why I believe companies should make more efforts in boycotting excessive packaging. \n\nOn the one hand, many producers manufacture commodities and put them in boxes as a means of attracting customers to buy their products. However, some of the materials that are used in making such packages are not eco-friendly and has led to the depletion of the ozone layers in recent years. For this reason, industries as a whole will benefit greatly from looking for environmentally friendly alternatives for their products. \n\nConversely, buyers also play a role in saving the earth from harmful activities by stopping the purchase of items wrapped in large amount of plastic covering. This will result in the less demand for such item and it will directly limit manufacturing, thereby causing a decline in sales. For example, in Nigeria the massive reduction in the purchase of packaged meat from a particular meat vendor led to the company to invent jut bag for their meat sales. Moreover, customers can replace nylon packed groceries with re-usable shopping bags that are not dangerous to the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, although individuals have a role to play in the reduction of packaged consumable. I believe companies and shops have more responsibility in ensuring that their products are not detrimental to the ecosystem.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people decide on career path early on their lives and keep to it. This, they argue, leads to a more satisfying working life. To what extent do you agree with this view? What other things can people do in order to have satisfying working life?\"\nEssay:\n\"A number of employees may agree that constructing professional career early and staying on it is required as a way to acquire comfortable working routines. As a worker, I have same perspective with the earlier people's notion which will be detailed in the following paragraphs. Moreover, there will be another straightforward occasion which can be implemented in order to create enjoyable working circle.\n\nTo begin with, building an exceptional career early and focusing on it can create comfortable ecosystem inasmuch as they will have comprehensive understanding when they finish their daily routines. Based on that, workers can do their jobs exceptionally which will increase productivity. As a result, numerous compliments can be reached and production will be operated without any obstacles which can release satisfying in the internal circle of corporation. For example, I initiated my profession couple of years ago without altering corporation which gave satisfying condition.\n\nTurning to another action, making sure that all duties in the company will fit with worker's background may gives a consequence that the employee will relish their responsibilities. For instance, I just selected the perfect profession based on my academic track as a way to make sure I could do my deskjobs excellently. Consequently, there was no enormous issue when I was a part of corporation previously and I always did my routines with cheerful condition. In other words, from the previous illustration, having tasks which are relevant with worker's credential can avoid massive problems later.\n\nTo conclude, I redeclare that having a supporting circle in our working life can be done by initiating professional record untimely and staying focus on it. In addition, an occasion such as fitting duties which will be done with our qualification is required to realize the earlier condition.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den quan diem cua ban ve viec xay dung su nghiep som va tap trung vao no de co mot cuoc song cong viec hai long.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the future, people may no longer be able to pay for things in shops using cash. All the payments may have to be made by card or using phones.\nDo you think this will happen one day?\nWhy do you think some people might not be happy to give up using cash?\"\nEssay:\n\"With the evolution of technology, the use of credit/debit cards or phone transactions for payments is being preferred over  classic cash payments. Thanks to the pandemic in 2020, most people are opting for a cashless transaction.\n\nAs of today, the need to pay using cash has definitely been reduced. Some people prefer to pay using a card or UPI rather than carrying the entire wallet along with them. For example, there are a few street vendors who are also changing their business strategies and accepting other modes of payment as well. Even in the ,future only a half section of the population would prefer an online payment.\n\nAnswering the question of the crowd would completely avoid note payments for things, I partly disagree and partly agree with it. The reason for my disagreement is the survey conducted by the Times in 2021, 16% of the world's population lives in extreme poverty. It is extremely difficult for them to have proper shelter, food and medical access; let alone open a bank account. The only way for their mode of survival would be cash. Apart from the poverty factor, there are many folks who prefer to use currency because it gives them a sense of mindful spending rather than splurging.\n\nI would agree that the currency might be totally avoided or banned and might start using cryptocurrencies. I personally feel, the greatest benefit would be to avoid using paper for printing notes, they can help the environment if we do not cut trees ,especially for paper.\n\nThere would definitely be a section of the crowd that most definitely wouldn't be happy about the use of online deposits as I have stated above regarding the mindful expenses, currency can be useful where there's a slow network or no connectivity to the Internet at all.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say notes and coins should remain in the picture and also the UPI mode of deposit, since the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response la mot trong cac tieu chi quan trong de danh gia do tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va kha nang phat trien y tuong trong bai viet cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. Some people think that this is good for a country , while others believe government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn. Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"A certain amount of the population is withdrawing handsome amounts of pay in several nations, some believe that this is a positive for that nation, while on the other hand, some argue that the government should act to restrict the amount to be paid to them. I fully endorse the first notion that earning high is prosperous for that nation, and instead of restricting their salaries government should encourage projects to foster more development and growth and should pave the way for others to earn higher, however, we would be discussing both the arguments below.\n\nTo begin with, a certain amount of the public  narrates that the authorities should restrict the amount being paid. This can be helpful ,especially in developing countries where the government can keep a check and balance on their people by curtailing down aspects such as money laundering through tax invasions  because this phenomenon is true to the extent that the elite class that earns more are involved in tax invasions, and that they are laundering their money illegally to buy assets in other parts of the globe. For instance, a report from the United Nations highlighted that the higher class in African and Asian countries have been buying assets in many parts of Europe through means of money laundering. This notion of limiting  pay can  also be useful to create harmony among the public so that the rich don't get richer and the poor don't get poorer. \n\nOn the contrary, some perceive that this is beneficial for the government and their country. The government could benefit from the fact that their tax collection will increase, in ,particular they would have much more amount to spend on the general public. To simplify, they can use this income to start new development projects and invest more in areas where higher incomes can be generated. To illustrate, India has been growing rapidly due to the number of millionaires increasing in their society, hence, new projects of growth and development are being made available to the public. This argument can also encourage many others to earn more income and be successful in their lives. \n\nFurthermore, I believe that the government should promote more public to earn handsome amounts of pay and that this will benefit the country as a whole. In other words, high pay will help improve the living standards of many and the nation will have much more money from taxation to spend on prosperous projects such as IT schools and high-class hospitals. \n\nTo conclude, regulating salaries might be helpful to restrict tax invasions but the overall government should motivate higher incomes as this could provide them with a sufficient amount of funds to increase development and growth.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va trinh bay ca hai luong y kien cua van de.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Small Scale shopes are reducing in recent days ,talk about your opinion on this.\"\nEssay:\n\"In this contemporary era, the shops which run at a small level are declining at a rapid pace. I firmly opine that the basic cause of this trend is the establishment of  lavishing big stores as a way to flaunt  wealth. This put deleterious impacts on the income of small retailers and also becomes a hurdle for the public, who have the minimum capacity to spend.\n\nTo commence with, the major point of this deteriorating phenomenon which is earning level of small businessmen is going into vain. This is because the attractive hoardings of immense supermarkets influence the consumers as a consequence, no customer visits the little shops which badly affects their demand for the product. Moreover, the quality of goods  stops them to buy from small-scale shops. For instance, as per the survey conducted in America, it is believed by the majority of locals that giant malls are efficient due to the availability of distinct products such as clothes, groceries, food items, and accessories in one place. Thus, convenience is the factor leading to reduce sales in small markets.\n\nFurthermore, another reason why people modify their choices is to show their status. This is because the big malls provide branded products which are considered quite fashionable and trendy instead of cheaper shop goods as people imitate their peers and visit the same shop which their mates do and utilize the huge amount in all things, only to maintain their sterling image which affects the portion of the community who cannot afford such expensive things.For example, a number of individuals with  credit card limits have to be suffered from losses due to overindulging towards big stores which creates an obstacle for them. Thus, small markets are the best way to purchase in large quantities at reasonable prices.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that although malls are beneficial for buying partywear clothes and things for special occasions, still small markets are helpful in various ways such as in saving income and maintaining the simple living of people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response:\n- Trong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach phan tich nguyen nhan chu yeu dan den su suy giam cua cac cua hang quy mo nho.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people believe that schools should teach children to become good citizens and workers rather than independent individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? give your own opinion and relevant examples.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, people think that shaping children to become good societies and workers through schools is more important than creating them independently.\n\nOn the one hand, producing students to have better workers is the task of schools to support our government goals. The children having this can give their contributions not only to themselves  but also to other people. Furthermore, schools are the tool of government that can use for accelerating the development plans.For instance, a graduated data scientist having skills in processing huge data  definitely can assist the administration in deciding a better regulation based on data. So, the authorities can provide people with better decisions. \n\nOn the other hand,  educational institutions must be able to teach learners to be more independent. It is an essential thing since children will be forced to solve q particular problem in future. They need to be adopted by letting them either  work or  overcome many challenges individually. Moreover, the pupils will get lots of lessons by having this treatment which can use the advantage of this to improve their confidence and abilities. Thereof, they can survive in various conditions in life since they already experience many hard things otherwise they will be in trouble and required to adapt themselves very hard.\n\nIn conclusion, I totally disagree with this view because I believe that educational institutions have to create and push  children to have and find their characteristics in order to prepare them for  life with fraught  challenges.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that in order to solve traffic and transportation problems people should be encouraged to live in suburbs or countryside rather cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Opinions are divided on whether the solution for traffic and transportation problems lies in the outskirts of the cities or within themselves. Although I acknowledge the feasibility of the aforementioned proposal, I firmly disagree with this idea. \n\nThose who advocate relocating to the surrounding area of the cities may have some merits in their arguments in terms of new modern road systems. They may well point to the fact that these areas would be more well-planned and developed, hence larger capacity for traffic as well as shorter traveling time. This would greatly benefit the local population as they can allocate more time to take care of other pressing matters in their life. Nonetheless, this approach is flawed as the increasing population will continue to choose cities as a place to catapult themselves on their career path, and, as a result, worsen the situation. \n\nFrom my perspective, policymakers can tackle this situation with the introduction of new traffic regulations as well as the promotion of public transport. Regarding the former, the government should impose a fee on all private-own vehicles during rush hours. This would discourage a substantial amount of the population from using their vehicle and consequently force them to use buses, trains and carriages. Big cities in China, for instance, give “points” to citizens who choose to commute by state-owned bus companies instead of their cars, leading to a decline in traffic jams and a better traffic experience. \n\nAll in all, while some members of the public endorse the idea of living in the suburbs for the sake of relieving pressure on the cities’ congestion problem, I vehemently oppose this idea as, in the long term, novel traffic laws combined with the promotion of public transportations will prove to be more advantageous to the larger population.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nNhan xet chi tiet ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some companies sponsor sport as a way to advertise themselves. Some people think it is good for the world of sports, while others think there are disadvantages. Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate over the sport sponsorship of corporations. While some people think that this phenomenon is disadvantageous, others hold a claim that it is advantageous for the sports world. While the former is valid to some extent, I would consider myself an advocate of the latter.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, there is a wealth of tremendous benefits for the world of sports when being sponsored by leading companies, especially pieces of equipment for sports team members. With sponsorship, athletes can have enough money to pay for usual costs, which helps them decrease financial burden. For instance, Nike, one of the most famous fashion brands in the world, invested in Vietnam U23 football team in terms of shoes so they do not need to find external jobs to purchase and they can fully focus on practicing and bringing medals for Vietnam. Therefore, sponsoring sports brings about myriads of beneficial impacts for the sports world.\n\nWhile the advantage of sport sponsorship is widely acknowledged, its drawbacks still linger. Some companies opt for sponsoring popular sport programmes, which have a high rate of viewers, to promote their low equality products or services. For example, Bia Saigon, a beer producing company, sponsored Leicester-city football club and attracted their fans to encourage them to use their commodities which have bad effects on people’s health. Hence, advertising can cause a myriad of demerits for the world of sports.\n\nIn my conclusion, companies’ sponsorship for the sports world is tremendously satisfactory not only for those firms but also for sports teams. However, its downsides are hard to deny.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, it is much easier for people to prepare food. Do you agree or disagree with the statement that it has improved people's lives?\"\nEssay:\n\"With the advancement of technology, it is much easier for individuals to prepare food. Some people contend that this change has negative impacts on our daily lives, however, I agree with those who argue that its benefits far outweigh its disadvantages.\n\nProponents of the idea that spending less time cooking can lead to a lack of the opportunity of developing essential life skills, such as going to grocery stores, cooking diverse cuisines, and washing dishes. In addition, cooking with family members is a good way for them to communicate, which can remove their misunderstandings and enhance the relationship between couples as well as between parents and children.\n\nHowever, I agree with those advocates of enjoying the convenience that the technologies have brought us in terms of saving time for preparing food. By using an air fryer, a microwave, and an oven, we can shorten the cooking time greatly. In fact, dinner cannot be ready within 10 minutes without the help of these appliances. The time saved by this change has provided us with far more time for work and entertainment, resulting in a considerable increase in the productivity of one's work and more joy and fulfilment in people's lives.\n\nTherefore, I agree with the statement that being easier to prepare food has significantly improved our lives.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of high technology has decreased the time that we spend preparing food.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Stress-related illnesses are becoming increasingly common. \n- What do you think are the causes of this?\n- What solution can you suggest?\"\nEssay:\n\"People are increasingly suffering from sickness as a result of stress. This essay will discuss the main causes of stress-related sickness including longer working hour and increased job pressure. This essay will also suggest solutions to these problems including improvement one’s work life balance diet.\n\nPeople place themselves under these unfavorable conditions because the workforce is a competitive domain. For example, some people aspire to climb the corporate ladder to gain status and a high paying job. This often results in mental and physical suffering because they have to work overtime and take on additional roles which can be stressful. Some people believe that eventually jobs will be by artificially intelligent robots.\n\nMonitoring a good work-life balance and improving one’s diet are both critical to mitigating stress related illnesses. People need to realize that if they live only for work they will suffer either mentally or physically and a poor diet will further exacerbate these issues. For example, many employees burn out from working too much and neglecting family, friends, exercise and hobbies as well as the foods they eat. Therefore, in order to reduce work one must include a better ration of work, rest, recreation and dietary sustenance. \n\nIn conclusion, in today’s fast paced world more and more people are becoming ill as a result of stress.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Atomic energy is becoming more and more popular energy source. However, some people argue that nuclear power puts life on the Earth to danger.\nWhat is your opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"As atomic energy becomes more commonly used in many nations, people start to be aware of its threats to human civilization. From my perspective, despite the high-cost construction and possible dangers, I am certain that the benefits, which are sustainable and environmentally friendly, outweigh the drawbacks it exerts.\n\nTo begin with, a newly emerged source of power exerts positive impacts on humans and the environment. It is a universal consensus that nuclear power could play an essential role in the energy supply and does not exist in a limited amount like coal or gas. Therefore, after precious minerals being entirely depleted, people can replace them with atomic power, which is sustainable over centuries. Moreover, possibly the immense advantage of nuclear power is that it is eco-friendly energy. Unlike fossil fuels, the nuclear reactor does not create air pollution or release greenhouse gases to mitigate climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, many people are afraid of the dangers of nuclear plants, such as Japan's nuclear disaster in 2011. In addition, investors claim that atomic plant construction costs a fortune and is a waste of money. However, I think those thoughts are rather ill-founded as the facts are opposite. When running a nuclear plant, scientists usually take accurate measures to ensure the regular operation and prevent any potential risks. Also, the dreadful disaster occurring in Japan was a mere accident, and no similar disaster was recorded until now. Additionally, despite the high-cost construction, nuclear plants are inexpensive to operate, which means it is a long-term benefit. As a result, it would be unwise to abandon this alternative energy.\n\nIn conclusion, nuclear power not only sustains along with the development of the human race, which can fulfill global needs, but also releases unpolluted waste to the environment. Although people think that such alternative energy may cause new dangers and is expensive to invest in, it is hard to deny these overwhelming advantages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung yeu cau cua de bai va trinh bay hai quan diem trai nguoc voi nhau ve nang luong hat nhan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Forests produce fresh oxygen and participate in regulating climate. But every year tree cover of our planet is lessening due to deforestation.\nWhat are the primary causes of deforestation? \nTo what results may it lead?\"\nEssay:\n\"As deforestation frequently occurs in many regions around the globe, it poses terrible threats to human survival. This essay will first prove deforestation resulting from human beings and climate change and later admit hotter climate and soil erosion as possible consequences.\n\nTo begin with, the primary reason for deforestation is human activities to fulfill the demands. It is a universal consensus that in order to solve the shortage of accommodation, many regions are cutting multitude numbers of trees for land to construct or for city expansion. Also, large-scale deforestation for woods is regarded as one of the most harmful activities people have done to the environment. In addition, it is hard to deny that wildfire due to climate change can reduce a large proportion of trees on Earth. Recently, a drought last for 2 years caused a tremendous bushfire season in Australia between 2019 and 2020, which makes governors declare a state of emergency.\n\nOn the other hand, the negative effects of deforestation will be a hotter climate and soil erosion. First of all, jungles play an essential role in regulating the air. Tree leaves convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, which means if trees get chopped down, the CO2 released by factories and cars will increase in amount. Therefore, the overall temperature can rise due to deforestation. Secondly, it is proven that when trees do not cover the land, the soil will be eroded rapidly. Conspicuously, poor soil, which plants hardly grow on, may become a wasteland in no time.\n\nIn conclusion, the reason why trees cover the planet is lessening is people deforest for land and for wood and long-term drought. Such events will lead to global warming and soil wearing away, which can bring many species to the verge of extinction.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va co mo rong day du y tuong.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Developments in technology in recent years has brought great impacts to the lives of individual in the society today. I strongly believe that the current positive changes in technology has improved people's lives. \nOne of the main impact of technology on individual's lives is that, it  generate employment opportunities in different organizations. People who are computer literate have been able to be employed to various organizations like airports, companies, banks, and hospitals. All these organizations depend on technology in their day to day activities. For instance, computer experts have been able to be employed to places like bank and they make use of computer to store their data. Also, many medical practitioner have been considered for job opportunity because of their knowledge of computer. Secondly, development of technology improves level of communication. Many people from various places have been able to communicate maximally through the use of telephones, electronic mails and other social media handles. To illustrate, a  friend of mine was able to apply for a job inside her room, this application was sent via electronic mail and the organization replied back within two days of application. In addition, people have been able to reach out to one another through the use of telephone.\nHowever, technology has helped to reduce the workload at home and also improved means of transportation.Household chores like washing clothes and plates, have been made easier by the use of washing machine. Cars, aeroplanes, ships and trains have serve as means of transportation for people and goods. For example, initially, I normally spend about three hours washing my clothes but with the help of technology, I have been able to use washing machine for washing clothes under thirty minutes. Furthermore I get to my place of work easily buy driving my car.\nIn summary, although there are a lot of benefits attached to the advent of technology but our daily activities should not be dependent on it.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that only the government can make significant changes in society, while others think that individuals can have a lot of influence. What is your opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is considered by many that because the government has authority it is the only one that can make significant changes in the country and deal with the problems of the society. But, taking into consideration this question, it can be acknowledged that in some situations people together could be more powerful to deal with civil issues. However, I believe that the only people who can arrange transformations are the politicians and I will tell my reasons why.\n\nGovernment stands above the society which means it has the right to make decisions in such issues, like exportations and importations of the country, make laws related to environment protection, support financially firms and individuals and so on. Its aim to give the best for the citizens who vote for them, at least in an idealistic way. Controlling a country is easier by few people than by millions and it is one of the main points, thus managing the society to work and develop.\n\nIf some national have claims, for instance building a kinder garden where their children might play because there are not any in the town, then they have to ask the government's permission. It equally has negative and positive sides, because the governor could accept the request and helps to build one from the money of community or deny it. In the last case civil organizations are able to help but the do not have enough power and money to have great impact to make changes in the society.\n\nOverall, if we can understand how our society system works then we have the opportunity to make development by electing wisely because as I see the government has the most power.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban khong tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that students who achieve the best academic results should be rewarded. Others believe it is more important to reward students who show improvement.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"It is often argued by some that pupils with the highest grades should be honored, while others feel that those who improve the most ought to be prized. In my opinion, I believe that the reward should be given to those who have shown the improvement as this motivates them to develop more in academics. \n\nOn the one hand, some people hold the view that students of top rank should be awarded. They believe this because it is fair, and they should be rewarded for their hard work. That is to say, students usually strive to attain the first rank in the class, and the best way to pay off for their hard work is by rewarding them. However, I believe that they put great efforts not for rewards or any prizes but for their self-satisfaction and the future. For instance, a survey conducted by Cambridge University in 2011 found that students study and achieve highest marks only for their future career prospects but not for any rewards.\n\nOn the other hand, others hold the opinion that it is better to reward those who develop the most over a term as they will be motivated by doing so. I agree with this point of view because, rewarding someone while he is trying hard to achieve the best, influences him to keep working without giving up, and takes him to the highest level one day. For example, when I was a teacher, I used to honour and encourage the students, who were trying hard to improve the most, and most of them reached the top level by the end of the final semester. \n\nIn conclusion, although there are strong arguments to reward top ranked students, I believe honouring those who are keep improving over and over will motivate them to reach the top level and succeed one day.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem va dua ra quan diem ca nhan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Computers do not help children learn more effectively. On the contrary, the use of computer's has a negative effect on children's physical and mental development. To what extend do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the 21st century, it is obviously difficult to assess the contribution of computers to young people. While some people take the position that computers not only reduce the productivity of learning but also jeopardise physical as well as psychological growth of a child, I am convinced that computer's effectiveness depends on the way children utilize.\n\nOn the one hand, if a child is taught to use computer functions properly, it will, admittedly, offer certain merits for learning procedure. First and foremost, thanks to advances in computer technology, people from all walks of life will have a feasible opportunity to access orthodox education without the fear of physical factors, such as geographical distance, which has been hard in the days before - if not impossible. Not to mention that learning through computer, without doubt, ensures flexible studying hours. To make it clear, unlike limited time in conventional courses, people of all ages are able to cover learning materials at their own pace. This, apparently, acts as a contributor to their passion for learning.\n\nOn the other hand, it is inevitable that the dark sides of over-reliant on computers are even more tangible to children's physical and mental process. To commence with, in terms of physical health, those who are long-time heavy computer users are prone to obesity resulting from lasping into sedentary lifestyle that they only look fixedly at computer's screen. In other words, these youngsters will suffer serious loss of vision, back pain and so forth if they do not reduce the dependance on computer devices. Furthermore, unbridled use of computers, for all intends and purposes, exerts lethal impacts on children's communal lifestyle which has been scientifically proven that computer users have a proclivity for social isolation by virtue of their in default of real interaction and a sense of community.\n\nTaking into those above-mentioned characteristics, one can conclude that the influence of computers in modern days virtually rely on each person's approach, this can brought both positive and negative aspects to children's development. Thereof, moderation is the key.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach trinh bay quan diem cua minh ve viec xem may tinh co giup tre em hoc tap hieu qua hon hay khong.

Discuss both side and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Many people have many perspectives about where to live. Although some might say that living in urban is more convenient, others think that there are too many chaotic and pollution. This essay will explore advantages and disadvantages of both places and give an opinion at the end.\n\nNowadays, lots of major cities are facing with congested traffic because most of residents are dependent on their private car and commute to work where is their workplace located. Therefore, there are a lot of air pollution in the heart of the town and not only this but also too much noisy, especially during rush hour. However, somebody choose to rent or buy a condominium which is located in the right center of cities as this place is nearby their company and there are plenty of the convenient shopping malls and entertainment places, such as a cinema, a restaurant, a fitness center and so on.\n\nIn contrast, some families decide to live on the outskirts as it is more quiet and more fresh air, so they can have a better quality of living than stay inside the city which is fully of crowds. On the other hand, these groups may have to battle through the traffic problems as they need to travel to work.\n\nTo sum up, there are pros and cons between living in an urban and countryside. People have many options to decide whether which place is suite them.

In what methods they are produced or how much producers care about ethical trend to making them? I believe they intent to have more watcher to earn more money regardless to its consequences.\n\nIn first point of view, some families my does not need something that is displaying on tv, but as home wife see the advertisement will feel that is a good idea to have it and decide to buy it immediately. In another case, there is families who have young offspring who mentally is not wise enough to perceive everything in family situation. Therefore, they will have high demand while they are watching a new toy advertisement. Begging his parent to purchase it and crying all time. As a result his poor father will be finally obliged to buy the toy.\n\nIn second point, they may use psychological weaknesses; for example, by displaying a young lady with fitness body who is using some stuff on show to attract people for the good.

Then everywhere is demand of computer it would helps to organisations to find perfect match for job. Then, they need not to trained staff, they can get efficient persons. \n\nHowever, one of the major drawback is that it invite many health problems among young children they spent long hours in front of computers which effect on their eyes, obesity is another problem for them. Furthermore it increase gap between parents and their child they spent most of their time on computer rather than talk to their guardian. \n\nIn nutshell, I would like to say that even computer has many pros and cons.

In my opinion, animals should recieve a better treatment and not to be abuse anymore.\n\nIn the humanity history for centuries it was common to utilize animals for lots of tasks, like transportation. Most of them worked their entire lifes without stopping, suffering abuse. The animals were domesticated just to satisfy human necessities, with which most of people agreeded at that time withou questioning.\n\nNevertheless, more recente studies have proved that animals have feelings, not exactly the same as the humans, but some similars emotions. Nowadays, it is not necessary anymore to use animals for jobs, for research and even for feeding. With the evolution, all of this need can be satisfied with the new technology. For instance, there are different means of transport, even eco-friendly ones, also planty of other options to substitute meat for great and nutritive substances that not involve sacrifying animals.\n\nMore than this, animals should have recognized rights to assure them a healthy and safe life, not exactly the same as humans, but laws to protect them that take in consideration their aspects. As an example in Brazil we have some recent changes in law in order to forbid the use of animals in researchs and to penalize animals abuse.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that animals should not be employ anymore to satisfy individuals needs.

However, other people believe that they should offer courses that will be beneficial later in life\nIn this essay, I will analyze the points and present my view in favour of people who believe that students should be given the right to study the courses they like.\nOn one side, having a chance to study science and technology-related courses can bring many benefits. First of all, the world is evolving every day with the use of technology especially the health line. Most devices used in the hospital are implemented by technology talking about the intensive care unit. This helps in making work easy and also reduces the rate at which patients die. However, I still believe that students should be given the chance to study courses they like because not everyone has the ability to cope with science and technology-related courses and also studying their dream courses will benefit them and also the community at large just like those who studied science and technology related courses.\nOn the other side, Students can be better prepared for the career they like because more time will be spent on studying what they are interested in and also they will learn with more enthusiasm because they will learn what they like.\nPersonally, I think that some courses studied in  tertiary institutions aside from the science and technology-related courses are also well recognized because of their impact laid in  society. Talking about the lawyers and judges who give justice to situations. This has helped  society at large by making it a favourable atmosphere for us all to live in.When students are given the opportunity to study the courses they like it gives them the opportunity to extend their range of interest and also helps them develop important characteristics such as self-confidence, and high self-esteem because they were not forced to study courses they did not like.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai: \"SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD STUDY WHATEVER THEY LIKE.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is the responsibility of schools to teach children good behaviour in addition to provide formal education.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is argued that schools should teach students to be good people apart from providing formal education. I completely agree with this statement because children spend long hours at schools, and parents have to pay for tuition fees.\n\nSchools should be responsible for teaching children to have good manners because children spend a significant amount of time at schools. This is because when children spend a lot of time with teachers who usually act as role models for them, students can learn and imitate good manners. For example, students from one of the most famous schools in Thailand reported that they behave themselves well because their teachers instilled good values in them while studying at schools.\n\nAnother reason is that parents have to pay for tuition fees, so they expect their children to become good people. This is due to the fact that parents expect their children to be successful both professionally and personally. For instance, international schools in Thailand charge parents a lot of money, so their parents expect their children to be excellent not only at academic subjects, but also good manners.\n\nIn conclusion, schools have to be responsible for teaching about good manners because children spend a lot of time at schools, and parents have to pay for education costs.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dung voi yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"At present the population of some countries include a relatively large number of young adults, compared with the number of older people.\nDo the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer with relevant example.\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent times, some nations have a comparatively large number of young people than the number of older people. Possessing younger people than  older ones has both positive and negative sides as well. However,  positivity never outweighs the negativity. The following essay will explore the two sides and provide a plausible example. \n\nTo start with, there is a saying that young adults are the future of any nation. The contribution of young adults in numerous sectors of the country is huge. Hence, with the help of their strength and ,fitness they easily take the leadership of any sector. For example, the economy, employment, sports and defence cannot be imagined without the performance of young people. Moreover, young people have the courage and motivation to take responsibility which cannot be done by  older people.  For example, a recent study demonstrates that, young people have 60% more stamina and courage than old people. Therefore, countries are fully dependent on the young generation more than the old ones.\n\nConversely, if the volume of the young generation outweighs the old ones obviously that will have some demerits. Building a nation with both younger and older people is necessary. The old people are the forerunners of  a country and the young generation always follow their footprints. For example, the old generation can easily be friends, philosophers and guides of the young generation. Furthermore, the old generation can help the young generation in learning new things and ideas and share their experiences with the younger generation. Therefore, to build a country both young and old people are required.\n\nTo conclude, although the volume of the young generation outweighs the old generation, it does not outweigh the merits of the younger generation. However, to achieve a balanced society and nation there are no alternatives for younger people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTren co ban, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that money is the best gift for teenagers. Others disagree. \nDiscuss both these views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, people give a gift to their family, relatives, and friends in different outstanding circumstances like birthday, wedding ceremony, etc. Some people believe money is the best gift to give youngsters, but to the best of my knowledge, I completely disagree with this statement.\n\nOn the one hand, money is a better present in today’s sluggish economic condition than. Money helps adolescents to balance their expenditures and also instead of receiving unsurprising presents, it helps them to act independently. They can readily manage their budgets and acquire exactly what they need. For more clarification, I mention an example of my own experience here. About eight years ago before my twenty-year-old birthday, I got in trouble and needed money. Close friends of mine and my parents, as they knew my poor economic condition, decided to give me money as a gift on my birthday that helped me to handle that situation. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best presents that I have ever experience in my life and never be forgotten.\n\nOn the flip side, some people disagree that money is the best gift to give. Gifts must be different in each situation due to various factors such as ambiance, age, type, etc., so choosing a present among the various infinite gifts would be an invaluable job. It helps us to experience a distinct sense that someone spends his or her time to elect a gift that is fitted or can fill our needs. Moreover, gifts have spiritual values and we don’t assess or compare them with money. Each present besides its feeling and energy remains in our mind forever. It helps us to create a distinguished picture of our personalities and be alive in their minds. Also giving money is not good at all ambiances. About two months ago, I read a paper that conducted a survey to be aware of the tastes or manners of newly married couples. The paper stated that over 87% of the couples don’t prefer to receive money from each other and to some extent in some cases, they mentioned that their feelings and attitudes toward their wife or husband can be affected by this gift.\n\nTo recapitulate, it is clear that the disadvantages of giving money as a gift outweigh its advantages, so I do recommend to those who want to select a gift, each gift has an individual sense and money can’t act be a sense.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban co tra loi dung cau hoi trong de bai bang viec thao luan ca hai quan diem ve viec tien la qua tang tot nhat cho thanh thieu nien.\n- Ban cung cap quan diem cua minh o cuoi bai viet.\n- Tuy nhien, co mot so van de ban co the cai thien trong phan hoi cho yeu cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, many people choose to be self-employed, rather than to work for a company or organisation. \n\nWhy might this be the case? What could be the disadvantage of being self-employed?\"\nEssay:\n\"In present life, plenty of people prefer to work independently, than to work for some organizations. This essay will discuss why is this happenig and find some disadvantages of being self-employed.\n\nFirst of all, I ant to begin with saying something about its reasons of happening. People are becoming more clever and smart in this time. Thus, some individuals understand the pluses of being freelancer. People may make an adapted plan on themselves, make rules as they want. As a result, there will be no any disputes about working rules. For example, some people do not like when employers are manipulating on them, and there can appear a unexpected debate. Due to this reasons, the number of self-employed persons are increasing steadily.\n\nSecondly, this approach has the disadvantages as well. The crowd sometimes go to complete it, but ignore its drawbacks. Person's discipline will deteriorate when no one is watching them. Thus, their work will bring them less result than they expected. For instance, self-employed people do their work in any time they wanted. They have no a constant time to work. In other words their day and their plans will fail. It is the most common disadvantages of being independently\n\nTo summarise, after analysing the situation, it is felt that it is okay that many people prefer to being self-employed. It helps to develop the country. But they should consider any drawbacks of it.

I strongly believe that other types of progress are equally important for a government.\n\nEconomic progress it is a one of the main ways to improve the living conditions in the contries. From economic progress depent a lot of factors. For example, the prices for goods and clothes.

According to the information, that I read in websites around 90% of oil is located in Abu Dhabi, that is why Dubai did not improved cause of the oil effect. Dubai tried to develop tourism progress. According to the newspapers, every year Dubai earning around 900 million dollars from tourism.\n\nIn conclusion, economic progress is important for countries, but do not outweight the other types of progress such as tourism and sport.

In as much as this herbs and treatment options tend to be helpful atimes, it is a negative development as this drugs lack prescription, the manufacturers of them have little or no adequate knowledge and also a treatment areas do not have necessary equipment.\n\nTo begin with, the Orthodox method of treating illness and drug supply has many dangers attached to them in as much as they tend to be affordable. This dangers can be as a result of first, lack of proper dosage information. Human beings  at this point are left with no other option than to take over or under those of them which can lead to various conditions and even death.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better to be a follower than a leader.\"\nEssay:\n\"In daily lives people have various positions in various parts of the world. A differentiation occurs between leaders and followers. Some people prefer to be a leader and free; nonetheless, others like to be a follower and depend on others. As far as I am concerned, I would rather be a leader instead of being a follower.\n\nInitially, a leader is a director of a group and they are able to decide freely by considering both themselves and their group. They can decide or act independently when compared to followers and other members of the group. It is a fact that, sometimes, conversations and brainstorming can be necessary to find the optimum choice, however, a leader can make a decision by themselves in a risky situation without discussions. Or even a leader can follow their own path when conflicts arise because of clash of ideas since they have the power among the group. Therefore, a leader is the independent symbol of the group and they are able to play the dominator role of a group.\n\nSecondly, a person can gain confidence by being a leader and they can use their increased confidence in diverse areas. Followers often involved in such discussions or conflicts, they are not sufficiently able to apply their own ideas. Nevertheless, by leading a society or crowd, leaders incessantly obtain self-confidence. They start to decide more legitimately and calmly when they encounter stressed and pressuring difficulties with the help of their confidence. Moreover, this confidence can assure accomplishment for leaders. In different parts of their lives, they may be successful and canalize others with a sense of self-confidence., which could bring success  Consequently, being a leader also helps people to be more confident and fulfill in different areas.\n\nTo sum up, being a leader has positive effects and consequences. First, it helps to be more free and independent. Second, it also ensures being confident and determined. Up to me, I would definitely prefer to be a leader.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong chu de da duoc mo rong day du.

Artists and entertainers need that skill in their job to entertain people. Thus, I believe art is an essential aspect of modern society and should be embraced in education from the first level to university life. \n\nTo begin with, entertainment such as music and art gallery is indeed important for people to cope with stressful and pressure daily routine jobs because they will assist to make relax and be happy.

In fact, art should be embedded in all curriculum subjects of study from primary school to university to encourage  creativity and have a good sense of their product-making, regardless of their educational background. For instance, when pupils add art sense to their creation to make the user interfaces of apps, it leads to eye-catching and colourful.\n\nIn conclusion, art cannot be imparted from current modern life as well as it should be attached to all levels of education from elementary to university.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people fail in school, but end up being successful in life.\n\nWhy do you think that is the case?\nWhat is the most important thing to succeed in life?\"\nEssay:\n\"In our society we are taught that the person who has the best scores in school, is the one that it's going to succeed most in life. However, that is not always the case. In my opinion, this happens a because the real life is more about how agile and active is somebody when doing their job. Therefore, the most important characteristic that someone could have to succeed it's to be hard worker.\n\nThe knowledge it's so important in any job because this helps to do things in the right way.Nevertheless, if someone has a lot of information in their brain, but they don't have a good attitude to work, they are not going to progress in their life. My own personal experience is a good proof of this.\n\nWhen I was in school, I had a friend called Maria who was the best student during my whole career. She had the best scores in my class. But, when we had to go to practice with animals, she was the worst. She couldn't handle a cow; she was always having a bad attitude, being lazy, and she didn't want to help others. Right now, she hasn't been able to last in any company. I think, this is related to her personality.\n\nHard worker doesn't mean to be strong. Being a hard worker means to have the best predisposition to do a good job and finish it fast. People like that are always supporting others, transmitting good vibes, communicating well, learning from failure, and wanting to be better each time. That is what people needs to be successful in life.\n\nTo conclude, work hard play harder.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban khong hoan toan tra loi dung vao cau hoi de bai.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Whether giving doctors, nurses and teachers higher salaries than sportsmen and entertainers is a hot debate in society. Despite the superstars also making plenty of contributions, professional workers definitely work more so that they deserve to earn more.\n\nDoctors and nurses always work in the front line, which makes them sacrifice their own time with their families and even their lives ,especially the emergency moment. As we all know, the pandemic last few years brought us trouble. As we stayed at home and complained about the lockdown, doctors and nurses were working with the high chance to get the virus. They  might lose their lives.In conclusion, they deserve to get more money. \n\nTeaching requires high responsibilities and  patients. Teachers need to keep learning all the time, then they can cultivate a better generation. It is not an easy job and it needs more intelligent people to do it.  If the pay is lower than superstars, students might give less respect for this job,which is able to lead  to a shortage of teachers in the future. \n\nTo sum up, professionals are not only responsible to the individuals now,for example, doctors and nurses save people from dangerous situations, but also are obliged to the society's future. Fewer people will contribute to our society if there are not enough teachers.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, Task Response da duoc the hien mot cach tuong doi tot.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is important for people to take risks, both in their professional lives ad their personal lives. \n\nDo you thing the advaatges of taking risks outweigh the disadvanatges?\"\nEssay:\n\"Taking risks are really vital for people either for their personal lives or their work lives. I believe that the negative effects to take risks are greater than positive ones. However, this is depend on what in stages people’s life, the younger the better people taking risks. This essay will describe about this issue further. \n\nOn the one hand, taking risks are needed in people’s life, especially when someone are younger. The reasons are without taking risk someone cannot move forward ad they are also will not experiences what the challenges their future will be. For example, people in age early 20s who want to start a business, taking a risk is required to take a new step. Businessmen should start taking the opportunity and take a different way to look different and unique so that they can compete with the market and with their rival. Another reason is taking a risk in the younger age can make up because they can run a plan B or other plans. \n\nOn the one hand, most of the time people who turn in to age 40s or even 50s is not wise to take a risks over their professional lives and personal lives. Regards professional lives, it is hard to change their career path because the failure and learning from failure are appropriate when people still in the younger age, so they can make up form the failure easily. Moreover, for personal lives, people in the age around 40s to 50s are not easy to make a relationship. Their peers are already having the stable personal lives and already focuses on their own family. So it is late to taking risk in the over mature age. \n\nTo sum up, taking risks are pivotal for people in facing their live both professional lives and personal lives. I believe the disadvantages outweigh the advantages especially people who turn on age 40s and 50s.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da dua ra y kien cua minh ve viec loi ich cua viec chap nhan mao hiem co vuot troi hon nhuoc diem hay khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some cities around the world, governments provide public transport free of charge to the public. \n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of this situation?\"\nEssay:\n\"Is is believed by a number of people that in metropolitan cities, public transportation must be provided without any charges. However, despite the positive aspects of this amenity there are some drawbacks. Both of the rides will be discussed in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nOn the one hand, free travel in public vehicles can certainly bring benefits for the people especially in financial terms. For individuals, as a monetary assistance by authorities as the daily commute fare will be saved. Additionally, on a boarder scale, a considerable impact of this phenomenon is on environment. To illustrate this approach,  because public transport will be free, people will give priority to it rather than using their own conveyances. Ultimately, this trend will assist in tiding over population problems as automobiles are a major source of air pollution due to the emission of hazardous fumes into the atmosphere. Eventually, a decrease in traffic congestion will automatically occur due to diminished use of private vehicles. Hence, there are immense advantages of free public transportation.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, it is also possible that free travel in public vehicles can put detrimental effects on the smooth functioning of governmental policies. For instance, in a recent publication, it stated that in developed countries, income from public transportation accounts for 6:1 to 12:1 of the GDP. Therefore, it is obvious that this considerable proportion of revenue will not be available and further expenditures such as maintenance, investment and salaries will put an additional financial burden on authorities which could have been used in alternative needy sectors. So, it cannot be considered as a wise decision to make public transportation free of charge.\n\nIn conclusion, even though many people suggest to make urban transportation to facilitate the journeys for city dwellers, it will not help the bodies economically which is the major drawback against several benefits of this suggestion.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong phan Task Response, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den ca loi ich va nhuoc diem cua viec cung cap giao thong cong cong mien phi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that newly built houses should follow the style of old houses in local areas. Others think that people should have freedom to build houses of their own style. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"There are those who think that people who make houses newly have to comply with the traditional style in municipal areas, whereas others consider that they have to design their own residences by themselves. Deciding whether or not it is wise to own style is subjective but for many it can be positive. \n\nOn the one hand, if new citizens follow the conventional custom to create their dwellings, it would render the scenery of the town beautiful. To be specific, it would make the local area more famous in the country. For instance, one city in Kyoto decided a rule of building to oblige the traditional form in 2018, it generated some positive effects on the residents and town because it became the most popular area in Japan in 2020. Thus, this trend would produce some beneficial results. \n\non the other hand, a lot of individuals build their own dwellings since they want to live in their favorite houses. It means that house owners design what they would like to do in their own residences. To illustrate, many families attach a garden in their houses to fulfill their hope such as playing with their children or watching nature. Hence, if newcomers are able to erect their home freely, they can design what they like. \n\nIn my view, it depends on what house the person like to live in. There is no specific residence that fits everyone, and I think if individuals think that harmony with other residents is more essential than their favorites, they should comply the rule of old house, and vice versa. \n\nIn conclusion, there are pros and cons for traditional custom and own style. It depends on the individual’s choice. Therefore, people have to consider what they want to obtain from their own buildings.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem khac nhau ve viec xay dung nha moi va cho y kien ca nhan cua ban.

Sevarel problem are being caused because of this such as air pollution ,traffic jams,late commute and so on.The solution is simple, government to encourage public transportation and inform vehicle users about to effect of detrimental .\n\nPrivet cars users need to understand that it is expensive and it is effected our environment.The first step is the introduction of high trolls in urban areas, and parking will be limited over the high price to park a private car. This step discourage to people who are use privet car. Privet cars users will be informed about the effect of detrimental and also privet car tax set will be high because of that it could demotivate car users.\n\nThe government should invest in public transport because it help to encourage to use public transport.For example, Air condition buses and trains will be the cheap rate for commuters. Making a public transport will be more attractive such as color, light and most importan is good buses driver. It will be satisfied commuters for everything. Less congestion in city is important, if government face the challenge then most of the poeple will be use public transpotation.\n\nTo sum up,day by day privet transport rapidly increases and it is a challenging for discourage people.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language can cause serious social problems, as well as practical problems.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Language is key to communicating with other people, and some people believe language is a big problem for someone who lives in a country where they need to speak a foreign language, and this problem leads to crucial issues such as social and practical. This essay will examine why I agree with this statement.\n\nTo begin with, living abroad is a dream for some people. Most of them want to have a better life and a better neighbourhood. The essential thing that people need to prepare is the language of the country they want to go to. Moreover, someone needs to know how to make conversation, not a short one but the complex one, because this is important to be accepted in new places or to find a job. For example, someone who chooses the UK to start a new life but does not know English will find a problem because they can not communicate with their coworkers or boss, leading to low performance in the workplace. As a result, it is not good for a new start.\n\nFurthermore, this is happening for more than just social but for practical problems as well. A new place means new rules. People need to know about the new place they want to live. For instance, if someone from another country decides to live in Indonesia, all signs on the roads, restaurant menus, and the local people use the Indonesian language. It will be hard for someone who does not know Indonesia to want to live here. This will challenge those who want to live in another country.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly agree that language is essential to connect people. This skill will bring many opportunities if we are good at using it in the right place. Otherwise, a lack of ability to use a particular language brings drawbacks.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la danh gia chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban.\n\nTra loi cau hoi de bai:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai bang cach dong y voi quan diem duoc de cap trong cau mo dau.

Now people are beginning to realize that development depends on the joint efforts of a large number of different groups.\"\nEssay:\n\"One of the widely discussed issues nowadays is that governments of wealthy countries should take more obligation for assisting impoverished countries in such areas. Now people are beginning to realize that development depends on the joint efforts of a large number of different groups. Personally, I tend to think that everyone should assist to each other in difficult times.\nFirstly, it is well known that a large number of rich lands have an opportunity to help. What I mean here is that they are able to create distinct events in support of poor society. One of the main reasons behind that is they have a wide range of facilities due to this they may pool their resources and improve lives in impoverished countries. A good case in point is providing jobs for qualified people from economically backward nations, so both sides can obtain mutual benefit and strengthened their relations. \nOn the other hand, it can also be argued that only rich countries must be responsible. That is to say poor nations should aim to become self-sufficient and do not attempt to rely on someone. Take for example, the situation with the COVID 19 pandemic, when the entire world was going through financial turmoil and needed assistance. Therefore, poor countries suffer enormously due to the lack of a competent economy and proper conditions for life so what they should do is consider every single detail in the development of the country to escape such terrible circumstances.\nIn conclusion, taking everything mentioned into account in our final analysis we can say that the optimum solution is to provide market access so the region can produce products and obtain regular income.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den viec cac chinh phu cua cac nuoc giau can phai co trach nhiem hon doi voi viec ho tro cac nuoc ngheo.

That is why when someone is not close to the beauty standard imposed by society, this person is available to make any change to be conformed to the one ideal appearance. So people start to, not only touch their faces and bodies with scalpels, but also to suddenly turn addicted to plastic surgeries until they get the image they have been dreaming of. Media once has shown a Canadian young man who wanted to look like a Korean singer, best known as a very trendy K-pop singer. After dozen of plastic surgeries, he tragically ended up dead with a heart attack and a totally disfigured face. It is seen that the reason to choose a risky option like the one exposed above, is so futile, is just to get an appearance approved by most people who follow a trend. Thus, I find this movement not only very negative but also very harmful for those who have chosen not to be satisfied with their personal natural appearance, other than being just like someone else in the world. \n\nOverall , I must say that the high-risk people put up their lives in does not worth it for so futile reasons such as looking trendy.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong danh gia task response truoc do, toi da nhan manh rang bai viet it phan tich sau va khong kham pha day du cac khia canh cua van de.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many children are encouraged by their parents to get a part time job in their free time.\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages to children of doing so?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many children are stimulated by their parents to work in part-time jobs in their leisure time. The main benefits are children are going to be more responsible and they will realise the difficulties of earning money. However, the main drawbacks are a lack of interest in school and unlimited financial independence. \n\nChildren are depending financially on their parents and they need to ask money from their fathers to buy the things they like. When children got a job at an early age, they will be independent individuals economically and, as a result, they will buy whatever they are wishing. If they are working after  school hours, they will have less time to concentrate on their school subject and, consequently, they will fail exams. For example,  students who are using their free time to work, are likely to have less qualified occupations in the future. \n\nThe first advantage is the work that they are working on will make them more responsible. This is to say, having a job is making people more aware of the problems that their parents are facing. Another benefit is children will understand how hard is to earn money. If they are gaining experience in earning money, they will be more careful about the money they are spending. Since they are receiving a salary regularly, they will be more aware of how difficult earn money. For instance, students who start to receive remuneration earlier than their peers, are likely to manage their money more properly. \n\nTo conclude, the positive impacts are children will have more responsibility at an early age and they will understand the importance of money. However, the negative impacts are they will fail in their assignments and have hazardous financial freedom.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va chua day du cac y tuong chinh ve loi va hai cua viec tre em lam cong viec ban thoi gian.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, a growing number of people with health problems are trying alternative medicines and treatments instead of visiting their usual doctor. \n\nDo you think this is a positive or a negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of individuals with health complications,  who prefer different procedures for their cure rather than visiting their regular doctor. Although A few think that having the same doctor can have disadvantages, in my opinion, replacement drugs are crucial FOR to treating patients.\n\nPeople who TRUST ALTERNATIVE MEDICATIONS MORE THAN DOCTORS have their own justification. First of all, NOW A DAYS MEDICAL SCIECNE HAS BECOME A PROFESSON  ITSELF AND DOCTORS CHARGES HEAVY PRESCRITION FEES, DUE TO THIS PATIENTS ARE NOT WILLING TO SEE OR PAY THEIR FEES JUST TO DIAGNOSE THEIR ISSUES INSTEAD THEY SWITCH TO INTERNET SOURCESS BY MENTIONING THEIR COMPLICATION OR IMPLICATIONS AND THINK OF OTHER MEDICINES FOR EXAMPLE HOMEREMIDY THEY FEEL THAT GIVING MONEY TO DOCTOR IS USELESS.  THE SECOND REASON CAN BE THE SYMTOMS THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THEY ARE MILD THAT IS WHY THEY DO NOT THINK OF GOING TO DOCTOR AND THEY CAN FEEL THAT THEY CAN CURE THEMSELVES  \n\nDespite the arguments mentioned above, in my opinion, trying numerous different treatments are worthwhile. On the one hand, by having a choice of treatments, one can not only increase their health astronomically, but they can also completely satisfy THEMSELVES  COMPLETELY  with other methods of cure. For instance, there are various options, like yoga, acupuncture, and Chinese medicines, which are better for treating patients. On the other, alternative therapies are less expensive and heal people from the inside out.  Meditation and Yoga are almost free and they are very helpful in giving relief from depression, anxiety and the like. For example, It can be seem in many diabetes patients, who have reversed their sugar level only BY PRACTING yoga regularly. \n\nIn Conclusion, while there are detrimental to attending their normal doctor, I still think that choosing other methods of treatments are more instrumental for treatment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nNhin chung, bai viet cua ban da dap ung cau hoi trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Stress-related illness are becoming increasingly common.\nWhat do you think are the cause for this ?\nWhat solutions can you suggest ?\"\nEssay:\n\"People affected by stress associated illness are rapidly increasing. This essay will discuss the two major factors that contributes to pressure related sickness and also provides suggestions to overcome them.\n\nTwo vital places which are source of origin for stress are work and family. Even though people spend most of their lifetime at work, many of them were not happy about their work or their employer. This naturally leads to stress related illness. For instance, employees under a poor manager will always face high level of stress compared to the workers under reputed manager. Secondly, family plays an influential role in creating the pressure. Level of stress will increase because of the constant altercation between husband and wife. For example, partners who are going through the divorce or on the edge of getting divorced will suffer from mental pressure compared to others who have peaceful family life. These emphasizes that improper work environment and poor family relationship will attribute to stress among the people.\n\nFinding an appropriate job and getting help on the family relationship will definitely reduce the mental and physical struggle among the people. Rather than spending the lifespan on miserable job, its crucial to find an ardent job. In order to relieve from stress, my friend gave up his software development work and switched his career path to teaching.  To improve the family relationship, if needed people can reach out to therapist. Although partners can communicate with each other on the dispute, they should not be shy to reach for external help. Stress can be averted to great extent by finding a quality job and seeking help on relationship.\n\nTo conclude, in modern world more and more people are becoming ill as result of stress. This essay discussed how stress is caused by unhappiness at work and week family relationship. This essay also suggested how finding a better job and reaching out to therapist for family issues will protect people from stress.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, Task Response da duoc dap ung dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"'Prevention is better than cure'. Researching and treating diseases is too costly, so, it would be better to invest in preventive measures. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the contemporary world, healthcare has been granted much more significance. In fact, an enduring argument is prevailing in society, contemplating whether the government should expend more money on the treatment of diseases or precautions. From my perspective, a magnitude of the health budget should be allocated to prophylactic measures rather than curing maladies. The ability to reduce medical care costs, together with the potential to build an efficient workforce support the premise. \n\nTo begin with, promoting preclusion leads to a dwindling of hazards which results in lowering the expenditure on healing ailments. For instance, the Sri Lankan state spent more funds on treating people infected with Covid-19, more than on precautionary initiatives. In essence, a substantial amount of wealth can be secured through bolstering hygiene awareness, as well as, circumventing impairments. Hence, a greater percentage of pecuniary resources should be contributed to prevention, in lieu of seeking remedies for ailments. \n\nSecondly, a robust labour force can be generated by creating a healthy community. As an example, a wholesome employee possesses the capability of assisting the organization to attain productivity ascribed to the factors such as less absenteeism, high enthusiasm, enhanced effectiveness and so on. As a result of the upsurge in individual efficiency, the entire economy gets flourished tremendously. Thus, ameliorating the aspect of elimination of hazards can be emphasized as more important than curing diseases once infected.  \n\nIn conclusion, the power to reduce healthcare expenditure, along with the capability to create a strong workforce can be recognized as the benefits of laying out money to avert hazards. Therefore, it is apparent that granting a hefty sum to reinforce literacy and cognizance of health is more significant than spending financial resources on treating illnesses. After an in-depth scrutinization of this arena, it is recommended that governments of every nation should allocate their consideration to the segment of evading impairments rather than striving to cure them.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va dua ra quan diem cua minh ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it.\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, advertisement has become one of the most significant parts of every business across the world. Despite the fact that it is an industry which is second to none in terms of importance to every society, people take some different opinions on this issue. Some of them accept it as a great factor in purchasing but others do not have enough attention to it. This essay will elaborate on both positive and negative effects of this object. I profoundly agree with the first group.\n\nTo absorb a wide range of costumers we should spend intensive money on advertising. Roughly, in both of domestic and international vocations, publicizing plays a crucial role. For this reason, that is a stimulating factor for everyone to meet their needs. As an example, when the dwellers are enabled to see some real announces on billboards in one city, it would make unconscious impression on their decision to buy their goods. Thus, this would be a lucrative idea in one community. \n\nAn alternative view is that, having sizable majority of publicities not only are not captivating to the people, but also it can be extremely uneventful to them. By increasing the advertisings, some residents find it as a repetitious problem. As a result, the percentage of shopping will decline dramatically. People do not observe the managers of big companies and their products.  A good example here is, one just goes to the center shop without having any knowledge of the brand, discount, and other elements. \n\nOne can conclude, advertisement has both advantages and disadvantages which are common in every trade. However, by having a powerful management, it can be reasonable and attractive for buyer and beneficial for the merchants.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, toi da nhan thay rang ban da thuc hien tot yeu cau ve Task Response.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think high-end technology can prevent and cut-down the rate of committing crimes. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is often considered by many that, living in a cutting -edge technology often reduce the the rate of crime in society. This essay agrees that living in computer era reduced the amont of crime in society. Firstly,this essay will discusss about mapping technology and secondly, how some extraordinary devices namely surveivlance camera and lie detectors can minimise offences.\n\nTo begin, firstly, technology has provided us much safety and security by sharing many useful applications in our mobile phones. in other words, compared to previous mobile phones now a days we have much updated mobiles where we can send a text or share a location when we are in dangerous situations, so that someone can track us and save our life in addition, creminals can be caught and punished. for instance a recent survey conducted by police department shows that 40 percent of criminals caught by tracking the place shared by the public when there were in trouble.  Thus, certainly, technolgy is useful in order to reduce crime ratio.\n\nSecondly, offences are reduced in urban areas by installing survevilence cameras in the areas with crowds namely street markets, traffic junctions and in some super markets. This makes offenders  to be more frightened and stop to themselves indulging in illegal activities. For example, In Bnagalore, there is an evidence of 20percent reduced crime rate after installing cameras on street markets. Threfore, adopting cameras which are developed in modern technology can mininmise offence rate.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that in this contemporary era, computer technology is extremely advantageous in order to prevent illegal activity by installing cameras and sharing applicationon moblie phones.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va neu ro quan diem cua minh ve viec cong nghe cao co the ngan chan va giam ty le toi pham.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Stores should sell local food products and not the imported food products. Do you agree or disagree ?\"\nEssay:\n\"Some people are of the opinion that the vendors should sell local food products instead of marketing imported products.  Even though it gives an advantage and economical benefits to the indigenous producers,  imported edibles cannot be completely taken out from stores due to its increasing popularity.  Hence, I partially agree to this notion. \n\nOn the one side, several benefits to the local food suppliers when their product is bought and sold in the local market.  Demand of the goods in the market at a tremendous rate when imported goods are reduced or completely excluded.  For instance in UAE 50 percentage of the fruits and vegetables are imported from Asian markets.  As a result of country ground water will improve the local market demand and supply. Additional, that is an income circulation within the country.  As a result, it is very suitable to consider selling local food products over the imported ones.\n\nThe other side there is a downside to this option of choosing ingrown food products. To begin with there is a huge demand for international consumables. People are ready to spend money to get there decide items. As a result if you stores choose not to keep imported consumables, the customers will go online to buy it is a very reliable and convenient option instead of using the local substitute. For the more, there are certain products which can only be produced under certain atmospheric condition and with the killer products. For example, Parmesan cheese cannot be made in every country because of the requirement of certain bacteria for optimum taste. Hence,it is not always viable to ignore their International products.\n\nTo conclude cal dispose should try every possible ways to support its own local products to get into market it is not always feasible to ignore the growing needs of consumers towards the foreign consumables.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that parents should teach their children how to be good members of society. Others, however, believe that school is the best place to learn this. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Some people believe that children should be taught by their parents about how to function as useful members of society, while others believe that sending children to educational institutions is the best way for them to study this. Although the latter opinion can be beneficial in some cases, I believe that family upbringing plays a more important role in educating children to be good parts of the community.\nSchools can be considered suitable places for children to learn to be good citizens. With standardized educational methods, schools can foster children’s cognitive development so that they are able to contribute to society in the future. For example, Trung Vuong school and Vinschool are well known for having nurtured successful alumni such as Professor Ngo Bao, Professor Nguyen Hung who have devoted their talents to the development of the country. However, these people only represent a small fraction of the total number of students attending schools, and thus sending children to schools cannot be the best method of educating them to be good members of society. \nI believe that parents play a more important role in teaching them how to be good citizens. In Vietnam, the average class size is 20 students, which makes it difficult for educators to provide proper schooling for each student. One to one lessons at home, on the other hand, allow children to progress faster. Furthermore, parents form stronger bonds with their offspring and thus, it is easier for them to shape children’s personalities at an early age. For example, by telling stories such as Robin Hood, Cinderella before bedtime, parents can instil a sense of compassion and integrity into them. These children are likely to become good members of society when they grow up.\nIn conclusion, although sending children to schools can be seen as a way of teaching them how to be good citizens, I believe that domestic upbringing has a bigger impact on determining who they are in the future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang viec thao luan ca hai quan diem khac nhau ve viec ai nen truyen day cho con minh tro thanh thanh vien tot dep cua xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"An education plays vital role in everyone’s life, it is commonly believed by some people that, the university study is very important in order to get an appropriate job. However, others think gaining work experience and development of skills is more important. In my opinion, both have their own positives and negatives but an education is essential under any circumstances.\n\nThe majority of people complete their graduation and masters from the university to secure an employment. Most of the MNC’s and mid-small scale industries hire new employees from the universities and colleges. In addition to this, it is feasible to understand and gain practical knowledge after the studies. With proper education it is very easy to understand the work while employed in real world scenario. Why the graduation is so important? We can understand by this example, people with adequate experience and skills set, but without an education cannot promote on higher positions as well as they never considered for bigger salaries because, market demands the education.\n\nOn the other hand, gaining an experience and learning new skills is essential. It is so important to understand work which is only possible by gaining practical understanding and developing skill sets. Practical knowledge makes things easy to understand and enhances abilities which can be used in real time. Why some people believe that the experience is important? This example will elaborate clearly; everyday new challenges are taken on chin by project/industrial engineers. In order to face those situations and provide feasible solutions requires an experience and skills.\n\nIn conclusion, gaining the proper experience and learning new skills is so important in the real employment practices. However, without an education, there is less individual growth in terms of self-development and career opportunities.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that nowadays we have too many choices.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that some people believe in this era we have so many choices. Developing technology and globalization give people more options in everything, such as education, jobs, and food. This essay will examine why I agree with the statement.\n\nTo begin with, decades before, the public just had a few choices, but now with higher demand from consumers, some businesses are making a transformation to get more buyers. They make more products to fulfill the marketplace's wishes. Long before, In one restaurant just had a few menus, but in this era, we can find a restaurant with more than 50 menus. For example, 20 years ago, KFC just had 1 menu, it was fried chicken, but now we can see they have more than 20 menus such as soup, bread, and burger. This is a good development because society is able to choose what they want and get satisfied.\n\nFurthermore, with many choices, people can explore what they really want. Developing knowledge leads many universities in this world to open new programs. 5O years before, people just know a few programs such as engineering, nursing, and education, but time many programs exist. In addition, some universities offer one program with different concentrations. For illustrate, the education program is divided into more than one concentration, such as teaching and learning, international education, and technology and education. This helps someone to focus on a specific study program for the future.\n\nTo conclude, choices are good for us to develop ourselves. People are able to find what they really suit. Moreover, many options mean people have the opportunity to get new knowledge.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTruoc tien, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"What are the advantages and disadvantages of leaving your country to live or study abroad?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays many youngsters are trying to move to another country in order to study overseas or to find other chances. There are some advantages and disadvantages regarding this issue which I will describe below. \n\nOn the one hand, some people believe that living in another country will give us opportunities to have broader social circles. Taking apart from our home and deciding to live outside our country would enrich our language skills. In addition, living in different areas could also make us understand other cultures. This also serves us with various kinds of new experiences and gives us many opportunities for our future. Moreover, it will also shape our mentality. A lot of people who study abroad become more independent. And their fight spirit will be higher. More importantly, it will also build our way of thinking which can be more opened by the difference. The more we understand the variety of cultures, the easier we accept the difference. \n\nOn the other hand, it seems that many drawbacks are believed to emerge because of the distance. First, we will feel far from home. I often found some home-sick friends during their studies. Also, many studies have reported  mental health problems as a result of missing their hometown and having no support system. Second, those who experienced long-distance relationships with their significant others may also realise some problematic relations either with families, friends, kids or their couples. Many troubles in relationships even divorces are being reported due to separation and distance. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are some benefits from moving abroad, ranging from building better social and future life to building a good personality, the negative impacts of this also exist. Thus, we have to take both  the positive and negative effects into account before we made up to live overseas.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la danh gia chi tiet ve kha nang cua bai viet cua ban trong viec dap ung cau hoi de bai va mo rong y tuong.\n\nDau tien, bai viet cua ban di vao dung huong khi tra loi cau hoi cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that it is a good idea to socialise with work colleagues during evenings and weekends. Other people think it is important to keep working life completely seperate from social life.\"\nEssay:\n\"Since our job take the majority of our daytime (or nighttime, that's depend on the job) our colleagues are a important part of our social life. We see them everyday and we usually have to interact with them many times. Do those interactions have to stay strictly professional or is it better including then in our private life?\n\nFirst, that's depend on everyone's personnality. Some people are good to keep distance during the working time's interaction, keep neutral conversations and seprate clearly the private life and professional life. On a other side, some people can't control it and their personnality will push them to be friendly with people who they get along with or be distant tp people with who they feel inconfortable.\n\nIn fact, it is important to feel good at work. A heavy atmosphere caused by tensions between coworkers could effect very badly out life even when we come back home.\n\nSocialize with work colleagues in the free time can be good occasion to know people better, away from the working stress and pressure. We can discover another part of personnality, hobbies. or personnal problems and then we can be more able to understand them during hard time at work.\n\nOf course sometimes in an other hand some matters can appear when line between private and professional life start be fuzzy. For example, when two coworkers becam a couple and continue to work together or when a friendship between two workers can be gossips' start point.\n\nBut since we are all humans with our own sensitive points, it is important to be keep a good atmosphere at work by speaking out all the problems to release all the tensions. Communication is the key but also sharing a good time with coworkers away from work can be a nice way to understand more each other.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den ca hai quan diem trai chieu va trinh bay y kien ca nhan cua ban ve van de nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The growth of online shopping will one day lead to all shops in towns and cities closing.\nDo you agree or disagree\n\nGive reason for your answer and include any relevant example from your own knowledge or experience\"\nEssay:\n\"imagine laying in your comfortable bed wearing comfy payjamas and buying that Gorgeous jacket from ebay or completing your office assignment drowned in the piles of paperwork still getting your most favorite sandwich from Subway. \nThats how convenient and fast life is with online shopping facilities. People now have a whole bunch of brands in their gadgets be it ZARA, NIKE or Pizza Hut, you name it and there's an app waiting to be downloaded in your phone or tablet. Few clicks done and you have that newly launched pair of shoes from zara at yiur door step. \nOnline market places have not only made shopping easier and fast but also made lives of introverts a lot more comfortable, at least now we do not have to be awkward when a sales staff personnel is glued to us while choosing items. Most people do not like to visit physical outlets, there are many factors that affect this situation. some of them are \n • traffic & parking issues\n • extensive physical activity for elderly people\n • crowded outlets and many more reasons\nHaving the best available produce on yiir finger tips is always a pleasure. \n\nThe growth of virtual market place and online stores is turning out to be a biggest reason for closing of shops and stores. The biggest reason is the cost to benefit ratio. To run a physical shops and stores extensive overheads are incurred such as lighting, music, staff cost, interior and rent. No matter if 1 or 100 customers visit om daily basis the store has yo bear fixed costs which fuel the declining profits. \nselling online is way more cheaper as it gives the flexibility of on point service, when a customer is genuinely interested they can visit the virual store and purchase the items, companies also buy bots to cater the queries and complaints of online customers which helps them provide more enhanced customer service. When there is no massive fixed cost attached the profits are higher comparatively. \n\nOne real example of dissolution of physical outlets is FOREVER 21. This apparel brand has shut its stores and now onmy focusing on online sales. Few more major example of online shopping boost is Amazon and Ali Express, these tech giants have challenged and distorted the idea of having physical stores. \n\nIn my opinion, online shopping is the future and brands should now adapt to the changing environment otherwise they'll be left as devestated as Black Berry was when touch screen smart phones came into power.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong phan Task Response, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve vien canh moi cua hang thi tran va thanh pho dong cua do su phat trien cua mua sam truc tuyen.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the future, it may be necessary for us to live on another planet. For this reason, some people believe that we should spend money now researching planets that could be a possible home, \nsuch as Mars. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many individuals believe that in the upcoming years/future, society might end up living in another world. Because of this Core idea, the community are thinking that it might be best we start spending most of our fortune on researching/findings to look into the best possible next home sphere like Mars. In my opinion, I consider alternative options will be more feasible and have a better success rate than the spending on a Space mission.\n\nIt is generally, argues by some nations that, doing research and finding the solution of the issues will help more than colonization on another world and I agreed. In other words, it would be more beneficial for humanity to survive and evolve with time. For example, if we provide attention to climate changes, deforestation,air pollution, and water pollution, it will rapidly increase the survival of the earth planet and provide a better environmental condition for living beings. Furthermore, Government and the private Companies have to work side by side to prevent rapid damages to the earth planet.\n\nOn the other hand, thinking about living on another sphere like Mars give me  excitement and a goosebump but it required a large number of resources, time, and money to make it happens/possible.For example, as per current situation, Scientist has noticed that wastage of natural resources is growing exponentially and finally it leads to dooms of humanity and the earth planet and colonization into other planets and starting from starch will give humanity a chance to survive.\n\nIn Conclusion, investing in colonizing another sphere should not be a priority while there is a better solution for the current problem. Deeply look into Universe is like a pipe dream and it should be left to the wealthy nation instead of spending taxpayer money.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai thong qua viec the hien quan diem cua minh ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foregin country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language.\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, learning foreign languages has become more common. While some people think the only reason why people should learn other languages is for work or travel, argue that there are more reasons contributing to this case and I personally think they are right.\n\nOn the one hand, the point of learning a language is that one can use it to communicate with others.  This is why some people think the only reason for learning other languages is for work purposes or travelling. This is considered a practical use of knowing a foreign language. In this case, there is no need to learn the advanced details of the language and the person can use it for communication with other people. The people who think these reasons are the only things that matter during learning a language argue that practical use of language is more important. For example, if someone gets a job offer from another country, it gives him a strong reason for learning the language of that country.\n\nOn the other hand,  there is actually more to a language than just learning how to communicate, therefore, people believe there are lots of reasons for learning a language. By doing so,  people can read books from other countries and become more familiar with their literature.  Learning a foreign language also enables people how to watch foreign movies in their original form and get more information about their culture and the way people of these countries live.  Since translation cannot always convert the meaning of these things, a lot of people study other languages for these reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that many people learn other languages just because of work or travel,  I think there are Muslims contributing to the purpose of learning foreign languages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDiem manh va yeu cua bai viet ban trong phan nay nhu sau:\n\nDiem manh:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang viec thao luan ca hai quan diem (nguoi ta chi hoc ngoai ngu de di du lich hoac lam viec o nuoc ngoai) va dua ra y kien ca nhan.\n- Y kien cua ban da duoc mo rong day du.

Other people think that, in today’s world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History.\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that some people believe the essential subject in school is History, meanwhile, other people say the crucial subjects are technology and science. This essay will examine both views.\n\nTo begin with, every country in this world has its own history, and from it, we learn many things, such as wars, kingdoms, trades, slavery, and many more. In Indonesia, we had a long story to get our freedom. Furthermore, the Indonesian government made a curriculum with some core subjects, and one of the important subjects is history. The aim was to tell people, especially students, how Indonesia gets freedom and to grow nationalism in pupils' souls. For example, in history books, they tell the founders, the heroes, places, dates, and how the story was. One person did not reach freedom was not reached by one person in one place, but every people in this country contributed to getting it. As a result, history is important and Indonesian citizens knew how the country got freedom and grew nationalism.\n\nHowever, in the globalization era, technology and science are developing. Public ease to access any information around the world. Netizens can get up-to-date news from their phones everywhere and anywhere. Technology helps people to work, ago 5 people handled one job, but now one job is handled by one person.  This encourages a country to put it into the curriculum since these subjects are crucial for humanity's future. These subjects aim to lead the students to become part of society and let them make human life improve. For instance, medicine is improving. Before many people died because of influenza but over time, scientists found a vaccine, and nowadays, the flu is becoming a common illness. Moreover, a country has some wishes that the young generation will make some invented and bring a solution to the country's problem, they say history is not important because it was the past and now we are in the present and need to be ready for the future. Many benefits from technology and science will help people to live better.\n\nTo conclude, history is an important subject because, from it, we know where we came from and what happened in the past, so we know the story, we can learn from our mistakes, and we are able to give respect to our heroes. Science and technology are also essential; from these subjects, our knowledge is broadened, and we will get answers to many problems we face.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some suggest than young people should take a job for a few years between school and university. Discuss what the advantages and disadvantages might be for people who do this.\"\nEssay:\n\"These days, millions of youngsters are being enrolled in universities every year. A certain number of people believe that young people should emphasize work at some time rather than continue studying in tertiary degree after high school graduation. This essay will discuss some positive and negative impacts of a gap year. \nOn the one hand, higher education is excessive money required an event. So, some young people decide to work hard to save enough money for paying their first year of university expenses like a tuition fee, a living cost and books. Money that they saved allows them to more focus on academic studies instead of worrying about the financial situation. As a result, they can achieve high academic result. In addition, there is a fact that people gain quite a lot of soft skills for example a time management and a communication skill while they are working, these skills help students to learn more in academic levels. \nOn the other hand, it is very often observed that many young people do not want study again after work a sometime. Basically, it can be said that motivation to learn things goes down slightly after work. A recent survey revealed one in three people under age of twenties never come back to academic study after a gap year. As a result, they will put themselves at high risk of unemployment in the future. Even some people decide to study after couple years of working, their ability to learn things usually become slower. Generally, this consequence influences their overall academic achievements. \nTo sum up, some people prefer to work one year after graduation a high school. Although, working a while after high school gives chances for students to earn some money and gain some skills from field work, there are some disadvantages, for example people’s learning ability become slower further some people never come back to higher education.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da de cap den ca loi ich va hai cua viec tre em lam viec truoc khi vao dai hoc.

The main benefits of not having a child for couples are that they can focus on their careers and have more time for themselves. The main drawbacks are that they could not fit into their peers’ group and have no one to look after them when they get old. \nOne primary advantage of remaining childless for married couples is that they can focus on their work. This is because they have less responsibility and distractions in their lives compared to the couples that have a child. Another advantage of this is that they have more spare time. Looking after a child is a full-time job for parents and taking most of their time, while child-free couples have lots of free time after work. For example, many couples stop going out late with their friends after having a child as they have to stay at home for looking after their children. \nOne disadvantage of couples deciding not to have children is that they can struggle to hang with their peers after most of them have children. Most parents prefer to spend more time with other couples that have children as well. Moreover, do not have anyone to look after them in their elderliness is another disadvantage. Children are the ones who take care of their parents when they get old because their parents did the same for them when they were young. For instance, the vast majority of the people who live in care homes have no child. \nIn conclusion, the main benefits of staying child-free for couples are that they can be more career-oriented and have more free time for themselves, and the main drawbacks are that they could have problems about fitting into their friends’ group and having no one to take care of them when they become older.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den loi va nhuoc diem cua viec cac cap vo chong khong co con.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that children should be taught to be competitive in school. Others, however, say that cooperation and team working skills are more important. Discuss both sides.\"\nEssay:\n\"People have different perspectives on whether schools ought to focus on teaching children to compete or work together as a team. While some people think that competition is more important, others consider that it is better for children to learn to cooperate with each other.\nChildren who learn to compete against each other often do better in school, according to some. In other words, the competition between students motivates them to excel in their studies or tasks which consequently produces better academic performance and results. For example, students generally apply themselves and work harder when they are in direct competition with their classmates. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that being driven to achieve the best is vital in order to succeed later in life when, as adults, they must compete against others in the job market.\nOn the other hand, it is often thought that it is better if the emphasis at school is on cooperating with others in a team. People do not live, work or socialise apart from others, so learning how to work alongside others ought to be taught from childhood. Without these skills, children would lack the ability to communicate with each other or know how to deal with confrontations and conflicts in a constructive way. Another reason why team skills are useful for children is that they can learn how to negotiate with others to complete a task which are useful skills to have for their future.\nIn conclusion, many people think that children need to become more competitive, whereas others think that it is best for a child to focus on working together.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem - canh tranh va hop tac.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays we can see definite signs of surplus production in almost every industry sector, and this is leading to environmental damage. What are the causes and possible solutions to this situation?\"\nEssay:\n\"In these times the production in every industry sector is increasing constantly, because of that we can see a surplus which causes environmental damage. This essay will discuss why this is happening and put forward several solutions for this issue.\n\nThe two main causes of the environmental damage are the use of chemical agents, which are many pollutants, and the continual request from the market. Firstly, the chemical agent represents the main factor of pollution. For instance, A clothing industry, which is the most polluting sector, uses them to produce different products such as fur coats and jeans. Because of that, industrial discharges pollute the water and cause environmental damage. Also, the continual request from the market leads a major production. For example, It is very common buying a new telephone every two or three years.\n\nAny possible solution to this problem are setting up a limit of production and buying used items. By setting up a limit we can reduce the use of chemical agents. Moreover, buying used items reduce the request and it is no more convenient for the firm produce in so large scale. In this way, we can preserve the environment.\n\nTo conclude, the increasing of the industrial factory causes several problems to the environment.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that every human can create art. Other people think that art can only be created by people with special talents. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is said that art is something that is inseparable from our lives. While some believe that only talented people can create art, I agree with those who feel that everyone has the ability to do so.\n\nOn the one hand, some people think that creation of art is only possible for people who possess special skills. They argue that only these people can be successful. For instance, human history only recorded the achievements of those artists who were famous in their field, such as Mozart in the music industry. Furthermore, it is sometimes claimed that not every human can survive in such competitive sector. For example, someone may be interested in acting but they cannot become a successful actor unless they are extremely good at acting.\n\nOn the other hand, I hold the opinion that creation of art does not require special skills. I think that such talent can be acquired through practice. Playing piano, for example, needs passion and long hours of practice in order to play the music without error. I wholeheartedly believe that all of us can become a professional pianist as long as we are passionate about it. Moreover, I think that everyone has the ability to create art although there is a difference between a good one and a bad one. It is undeniable that some movies are not as popular as some other blockbusters; however, these are still masterpieces regardless of the quality.\n\nIn conclusion, even though usually talented people are more likely to survive in the industry, everyone can still be a professional artist as long as they put in enough effort. Therefore, on balance, I believe that creation of art is not limited to any particular individual.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung duoc yeu cau cua Task Response.

While there are those who believe that educating their young ones the discernment of what is right from wrong; other opine that provision of safe environment and proper sustenance are parent's main responsibility to confer to their children. In my opinion, both views are equally valid and necessary inorder to effectively bring up their young ones.\n\nIn today's modern society that constantly challenges the morale virtue of every individual, only those who geared with discipline and prudence to choose the right path suceeds. For instance, most teenagers these days, sadly, are involved in risky behaviours as evidenced by increasing juvinile deliquecies. This is owing to the fact that most of them are coming from a familial background with minimal parental supervision and guidance. As a results, they are an easily drawn to make mischief and socially deviant behaviour as they are not aware of what discipline and moral virtue is all about. It is therefore, every parents responsibility to instill these values as they are, after all, every child's first teacher and role model.\n\nOn the other hand, parents are mainly responsible as well of providing their progenies which essential necessities conducive to their growth and development, that is a safe haven for them devoid of anything that would bring a negative impact on their physical and psychological aspect. In other words, parents should immunized their home against any forms of violence, agression, and opression. \n\nA home that fosters every child's right to education, proper food and shelter in order for them to grow with a sound body and mind.\n\nTo recapitulate, provision of safe environment and promotion of moral virtues are equally essential for  parents to confer to their children in order for them to raise a responsible and well-balanced children of the society.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai, ban luan ve ca hai quan diem va dua ra quan diem ca nhan cua ban.\n\nTuy nhien, co mot so diem can duoc cai thien va mo rong:\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Marketing and promotion is a key to successful business? To what extent do you agree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this modern trend, entrepreneurs believe that promoting their products are the best way to get success. So, companies from the lower scale to affluent companies are spending a lot of money in advertising. I do not completely accord with this point because quality and purity products would popular automatically.\n\nTo embark on, on the one side of the coin, the mesmerizing advertisements are attracting vast amount of customers to the shops. Besides, these are giving awareness for the people who don’t have much knowledge about the products and its uses. Therefore people are more concerned about the brands and buying them even they are expensive. Which is increasing the growth of large scale business and they are benefitted. For instance, nike, puma, rolex are one of the most popular products in the world and we could see their promotion everyday in our televisions\n\nOn the other flip side of the coin, few brands are not required any promotion but still they would more popular with their quality and cost. For instance, lamborgini car is one most famous and majority of the people’s dream car although, this car doesn’t advertise anything in the television. If a product or company has to be successful, it should be capable of making best quality and unique masterpiece for the world which automatically brings huge publicity all over the world.\n\nIn conclusion, marketing is one of the best and easiest ways to bring success for the company but without any advertisements also we can get success as well.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dua ra quan diem cua minh rang quang cao khong phai la yeu to quan trong doi voi su thanh cong cua mot san pham hoac cong ty.

Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"In every issues in the society,there are bound to be divergent views. Although it is often thought by some that accepting a terrible situation like lack of finance and having a job that causes displeasure is better whilst,other believe that accepting such situation and finding a way to solve the problem is best. In my view,I believe that trying to improve on a worse situation is better owning to the fact that it helps an individual achieve a better result and mitigate such situation from reoccuring.\n\nPeople who are of the opinion that accepting a situation that is bad say so because they believe an individual should always move on with life. This means that a person in such a condition forges ahead not minding or trying to improve on it. A person in such category think that one is more successful putting a bad situation behind. The ex-governor of Delta State is a prime example,his believe on being suuccesful is forging ahead therby seeing it as ones past\n\nOn the other hand,improvingin a situation which is known to be bad helps an individual achieve better outcomes of such situation. This is because, an individual has already known where he or she has defaulted in. Additionally, an individual being aware of what has resulted to such situation would avoid repeating the mistake again. For instance,a popular artist by name Tiwa Savage;in an interview granted to the sun television revealed the secret of her success as improving on a situation she finds herself in.\n\nIn conclusion, evidently from the points outlined it is explicit that working to improve a bad situation is a neceesity inorder to acquire a better understanding on how to tackle such problem if a person encouters such.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach tom tat ca hai quan diem khac nhau va dua ra y kien cua rieng ban ve chu de.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The speeding up of life in many areas such as travel and communication has negative effects on society at all levels – individual, national, and global. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, people can travel and communicate more efficiently than before due to the advancements in science and technology. While many people agree with the idea that the speeding up of life has negative effects on the community, I personally believe that its advantages far outweigh its disadvantages.\n\nFirst of all, at the individual levels, people tend to travel every year. They have to spend a large amount of money on different aspects such as accommodations, plane tickets or foods. At the national and international level, what often being criticized is the environmental pollution. For example, airplane and cars today, which help speed up travelling, emit more CO2, which could destroy the ozone layer and lead to the greenhouse effect.\n\nOn the other hand, people will have more choices and more opportunities to travel. This also lead to many potential jobs in tourism. Moreover, due to better communication, people are connected with their near and dear ones and distance are no longer a barrier. At the national level, it improves individuals’ efficiency and help to increase a country’s GDP. The rich nations are opening Multi National Companies in developing countries and providing job opportunities to millions. This is narrowing the gap between rich and poor. Thus, the economies of the poor countries are improving. At global level, it helps to improve international exchange and communication among nations. Because of this fast era of today, nations are developing doing foreign trade with each other. Moreover, through social media they solve global problems together such as poverty, disease or environment pollution.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the speeding up of life has both negative as well as positive effects. However, the positive effects are much more than negative influences\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach ro rang va co kha nang thuyet phuc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that it is more important to teach children the literature of their own country than other countries. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"The education is one of the important aspects in the world. Some people think that teaching the literature of own country is crucial to the children. However, other think it's not that important for Children. I support for the first statement that learning own country literature is very important.\n\nOn the one hand, there are so many languages exists in the world to communicate people. Some languages represents their culture. Moreover,It's our responsibility to remember the culture and make their presence exists. For instance, in one of the state the government declared Hindi language as their first language and the people in the state declared a strike to not to implement that and they want their local language as their first language.\n\nOn the other hand, one language, one world is the concept of the present society. Most part of the world communicates in English language. If you know English language you can survive in any part of the eastern countries. Consequently,learning English language provides more opportunities to settle anywhere in the country. In case if you don't find a job that matched your profile then you search in other country. Even you can explore the world and see different culture and taste different foods.\n\nTo conclude, there are so many advantages to learn other literature but one should not forget the roots and avoid learning own literature.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"People argue that the advantages of digital books or newspapers will lead to the disappearance of the traditional ones. I strongly agree with this opinion.\n\nThe primary reason why nobody will purchase the printed books and newspapers is due to their negative effects on environment. Conventional books and newspapers are made from wood, and hence a plethora of trees has to be cut to provide materials for paper manufacturing process. This could exacerbate the deforestation which is a headache issue of all countries around the globe. To address this critical problem, many goverments have imposed higher taxes on wood-made products, and books or newspapers are one of the bypass products of woods. As a result, the price of books and newspapers shoots up and forces people think about another economic way to replace printed books and newspapers.\n\nOn the other hands, there is a variety of advantages of electronic books and newspapers. Firstly, they do not need to be printed out on the papers so that they are very friendly to environment, and the manufacturing and printing of books and newspapers are significantly reduced. Therefore, their price is much cheaper than the printed books and newspapers, and people can afford to buy them. Secondly, people can easily update news or information anytime and anywhere as long as they have a smartphone connecting to wifi. This is an extraordinary benefit for busy people who has a limit of time per day. Finaly, the high quality and vivid image helps the digital books and newspapers outweigh the conventional ones.\n\nIn my conclusion, the purchase of printed newspapers or books will be decreasingly dropped and people will prefer to buy digital ones due to their obvious advantages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung tot yeu cau cua de bai bang cach tra loi day du cau hoi duoc dua ra trong de bai.

Firstly, the high number of younger crowd would put more\n\npeople in the workforce, this  would boost the local and national economy. Secondly, less number of elderly people would mean, reduced\n\nimpact on the health care system. To quote an example, the healthcare spend, in countries like Europe is high, due to  the increased proportion of people, in the age of 60 and above. Finally, there would be lesser disbursal of retirement benefits, going out from the national pension system, which would result in the accumulation of huge pool of money, which could be made available to the government, to spend on other productive initatives. On the other hand, lack of seniors may result in actions, without proper guidance and supervision, which would impact the society negatively. Rather than books, a rich experience is a lifetime learning, which is much powerful and may be lacking, in the individuals these days and they may take hasty decisions. To cite an example, in countries like India where there is a balanced mix of generations exist, seniors in the household always guide their wards on timely decision and put them on right-track. But with the technological advances today, there are online forums, from which one could get solutions.\n\nTo conclude, the immense benefit of having today's generation boosts the economic prosperity of a nation, increased GDP output, lesser burden on the healthcare and pension system. These positive points outweigh the negative points about not having elders to advise or channel in the right direction, due to advent of internet technologies, that could be sorted out.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da dua ra cac loi va hai cua tinh huong co nhieu nguoi tre tuoi hon nguoi cao tuoi trong mot so quoc gia, va cho rang loi ich vuot troi hon nhuoc diem.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"While many people assume that nationality mixture is irrelevant to the development of a country, in my opinion, it plays crucial role for both the entertainment and development of a country.\n\nFirstly, having a various mixture of nationalities can bring in cultural diversity, which means different kinds of core values, traditions, entertainment activities and dining rituals. All these deviations can result in diverse society with many enjoyful events that makes the base of an interesting lifestyle as a whole. For example, Mongolia has many ethnic groups that all have sub-cultures. So, various activities are organized throughout the year. Due to this, we are able to experience pleasant ceremonies and enjoy many foods, which brings us all together as a country and enables interesting experiences. That is why I strongly believe that having different nationalities is a key to an adventurous society.\n\nSecondly, country's development results from many contributing factors, but the reason why being a blend of nationalities is important is as different people have varying viewpoints and skills, so does different groups. So, the country is more able to build a society that is more structured and segmented evenly, which causes a rapid development. As an example, USA is a mixture of many ethnic groups, thus they are able to become one of the most powerful nation in the world. They are able to attract more tourists and develop all of their crucial segments equally.\n\nTo conclude, I agree that country's development and entertainment is facilitated by the different mixture of groups. My reasoning is based on two main thoughts. When population is divided into nationality groups, the country is able to become more interesting as a result of different culture they bring and more developed due to their skill sets and opinions.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du yeu cau cua bai viet, tuy nhien mot vai diem con chua duoc ro rang va day du.\n\nVe phan y chinh thu nhat cua ban, mac du ban da nhan manh ro rang su da dang van hoa se mang lai nhieu gia tri giai tri khac nhau, nhung ban can giai thich them ve tam quan trong cua khia canh nay trong viec phat trien dat nuoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"some people believe that it is wrong to keep animals in zoos, while others think that zoos are both entertainment and ecological important.\nDiscuss both views\"\nEssay:\n\"Now days, there are different prospects about keeping of animals. Most disagreements are about how to keep creatures and what should be the conditions. I will discuss these views in diverse directions of environmental, personal, and economic perspectives.\nOne of the most important advantages of keeping animals in zoos, is protect them from bad weathers, hunters, and feeding accessibility. In spite of this, if we create a lot of restrictions on animals such as, imprisonment them in tight spaces, they would not be able to have bracing air and pursue other animals. consequently, circumstances of keeping creatures are vital for living them. living animals in natural dweller must be major program for caring them in run the world, to give them the chance to exposure usual being.\nSome animals are becoming extinct therefore, saving them is very crucial. although huge budget is spent on keeping their, the revenues will offset all costs. Take a kind of Chinese bear famous as panda, for instance; a wide range of people travel to china to see these animals in zoos or circuses every year. notwithstanding; most citizens decline the investment of governments for caring animals and find it as futile. they prefer that states invest in improving infrastructure, such as build of highways, airports, hospitals and so on. this people consider the development of country more important than conservation of animals.\nIn the end, animals caring plays an important role in the advancement of scientific research whereas this approach has been rejected in sakes of morally and religious. most people believe we have no right to use animals of amusement and in labs.\nAs has been noted, keeping animals in zoos might have countless advantages in provided that they are not kept away from their natural habitat. Reasonable causes behind that, respect the rights of animals to have better living conditions.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da gioi thieu ca hai quan diem ve viec giu dong vat o so thu, tuy nhien, ban chi di sau vao uu va nhuoc diem cua viec giu dong vat trong cac dieu kien tot hon o so thu.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many animals are being hunted to the brink of extinction in order to fulfill the demand and greed of mankind for decorative purposes as well as for other reasons, such as traditional medicine.\nWhy does this happen?\nWill this improve or get worse in the future\"\nEssay:\n\"Being under long-term repercussion of human, the ecological balance has become vulnerable and some species are endangered. Frequently, an overhunting phenomenon is caused by a lack of regulation; nevertheless, hopefully, a conscious part of modern society will tackle this issue.\nA commonly held belief is that if an exploitation of animals tends to transform to a burgeoning industry with a significant market value, it has to be controlled by governments to prevent devastating circumstances, such as extinctions of species. Obviously, poaching or illegal animal trade must be punished, in view of the fact that some individuals are going to lose an empathy and humanity under pressure of a huge amount of money. For instance, gray whales had been virtually eradicated by a commercial whaling, until worldwide protection organizations had not signed a moratorium on this activity.\nAlthough current situation seems to be disastrous, several experts suppose that the future of Mother Nature could be an optimistic. The more resources on the social media show documentary films or a terrifying statistic about the animal kingdom destroying, the more people are involved in an essential process of a nature preservation. World Wildlife Fund is a prime example of an organization, which leads to create an awareness about taxing fauna’s issues and definitely has become a base of positive changes.\nIn conclusion, animals are treating by the irresponsible human’s behavior. Being a dominant species on our planet, unfortunately, not all of individuals realize a value of a creature’s life without strict laws. Yet I strongly believe that progressive society is able to turn over this trend, and the situation will get better.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cac cau hoi trong de bai va dua ra lap luan cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"International tourism has brought enormous benefits to many places. At the same time, there is concern about its impact on local inhabitants and the environment.\nDo the disadvantages of international tourism outweigh the advantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays people often travel from one country to another country just for a holiday or vacation. These kinds of activities are familiarly known as International or Global Tourism. There are a lot of benefits that global tourism gives to everyone, which could be in every aspect of economics of international exposure, but the problem is this condition can bring consequences as well. This essay will be addressing some benefits and consequences that happen due to this trend.\n\nFirst, for the advantages, At least two parties will enjoy the benefit of these activities. First is the Government. Because people are visiting a foreign country, the government will receive some amount as a duty that paid by the visitor. Second is the local people that live around those places where visitor visit. Local people usually having a business like accommodation, transportation, and Culinary that get profit from the visitors.\n\nOn the other hand, some consequences might happen, especially for nature tourism. For instance, some habitat will be impacted because of forbidden activities which are being done by some undisciplined tourist. To avoid these kinds of disadvantages, the Government needs to create some prevention action to make sure this won't happen. For example, the Government would create rules that every tourist should be accompanied by a local guide.\n\nTo wrap up, There are unlimited advantages that global tourism can bring to a country or even to the local people. These benefits will overcome the problem that might happen because of this international tourism activity. Also, To ensure there is no damage to the habitat and the environment Government must have good rules to make sure the damage won't happen.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nVe phan Task Response, bai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cau hoi duoc dua ra.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The gap between rich and poor is increasing. What problems does it cause? What solution can you suggest?\"\nEssay:\n\"The discrepancy is incrementing between the wealthy and the impoverished people. Due to this, economic prosperity is hampered and education is not conferred to all. To rectify the entire scenario, it is imperative to impart free education and open myriad job avenues.\nTo embark on, financial progress is halted. As one section of the society earns enormous revenue and pays back to the nation in the form of income tax, the other part of the community hardly generates any income to survive. Thus, contributing none to the national development. To exemplify, as per the World Prosperity Report, the highest deviation between the upper and the lower section of the society has been witnessed in Pakistan, and the nation stands in the first 100 countries to have a poor financial status.\nTo combat the difference, government should edify the destitude children free of cost. By initiating such a campaign, poverty-stricken children would make the most of it. Hence, education will entitle the populace to grab distinct lucrative opportunities to feed the family; consequently, the entire state would be financially autonomous. Another fruitful way is to start creating more employment options so that none is unemployed, and masses could be a substantial part of national growth. For example, the United Kingdom takes the responsibility to educate each and every child and tops the list of wealthy kingdoms.\nTo encapsulate, to mitigate the gigantic issue of divergence in the monetary position of the high class and the low class, the administration should take up the onus to bestow every citizen with the fundamental right of knowledge and start up projects to give jobs to the natives; otherwise the repercussion of the disparity, national development, would take a toll.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi va dua ra cac giai phap de giai quyet van de chenh lech giau ngheo.

According to me, it's advantageous for the employees, but causing a great loss to the industries.\n\nTo begin, the evolving changes in our regular needs and the ever increasing inflation rate has exerted pressure on the financial situation of various families, which have compelled people to look for other substitutes and change their profession in order, to satisfy their basic needs. For example, consumers started buying expensive gadgets and spending money, way out of their budget. Therefore, workers are unable to meet their needs from their regular jobs, hencehence, they started looking for jobs in different sectors to make higher amounts of money.\n\nFurthermore, short-term employment doesn't affect the worker much, but it has a severe impact on the production and performance of an enterprise, since training new workers waste a plenty of time, which could be utilized to enhance the quality of their product in the presence of an experienced employee.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that changing livelihood is a great experiment for an individual to try, until they do not struggle with the new work, and receives the desired outcome.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response trong bai viet cua ban da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that tourists should accept social and environmental responsibility while others believe that tourists should not accept any responsibility at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"During the past few years, with the ever-increasing number of tourists, the responsibility of visitors have become more controversial. While some people believe that tourists should be responsible for social and environmental issues, others think that they do not need to do that. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the former idea that travellers should be in charge of these problems.\nOn the one hand, a number of social and environmental responsibilities do not belong to tourists. The reason for this is that they think that except travelling times, tourists must bear a wide variety of social and environmental burdens. Therefore, on holiday, it is a great time for them to relax, wash the dust of every day as well as recharge battery after hard working days. Furthermore, the given argument is that service providers should be recharge of problems related to society and the environment. For example, museums should address environmental crises which are generated by their visitors.\nOn the other hand, I personally believe that tourist flocks should get involved in useful activities to reduce social and ecological problems. Firstly, in many places especially entertaining constructions, tourists there cause a lot of social and environmental problems. A good example is conflicts between local people and visitors due to a difference in cultural background. A great solution is that travelers should research thoroughly about codes of conducts in the areas they have a tendency to explore. Secondly, although there are a number of labours collecting garbage which is discharged by visitors, it is not effective if tourists do not improve their awareness to protect the environment.\nIn conclusion, some individuals argue that travellers do not pay more attention to protecting the environment and reducing social issues whereas I support the opinion that they need to cooperate with service providers to be responsible for these kinds of problems.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, noi dung da dap ung duoc yeu cau cua de bai nhung viec neu ro lai quan diem chu dao trong doan ket khong qua ro rang va kien dinh.

The essay is fully agreed with this statement and talk about why people think so along with some method in the following paras with a reasoned conclusion.\n\nThe first strategy that's unacceptable in these present days is misrepresentation of products. To be more precise, sometimes advertisers attach a slogan such as this product available for a limited amount of time, which consequently put impacts on people to buy the product within given time to take advantage of it without a consideration. For example, a TV channel Shop CJ, where always one time limit is displayed with all products in order to increase the sales.\n\nA second approach for advertising that most of the Internet users use is pop up of websites. Actually, it is totally irritate the dwellers, because what data they want, open after a several pop-up sites. For instance, the Techmahindra.com, where for every click one pop up site is open. Another adverts of this kind is related to those companies which hire famous personalities to promote and to encourage people to buy their products. A best known example of this is Varun Dhawan, who promote fairness cream which is often has some negative consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to point out that many advertisers use different approaches to advert their products and most of these methods are not appreciated by the citizens,because it's just encourage them to buy the certain things\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung rat tot voi yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more people want to own famous brands of cars, clothes and other items. What are the reason for this. Is this a positive or negative trend?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the trend of purchasing well-known brands of vehicles, clothes and other goods has been increasing. This raises the question why it is happening and how society will be effected. From my perspective, I suppose it will have a negative impact on society.\nThere are many compelling reasons why more and more people are obsessed with owning the famous brand of items. Firstly, Owing to the availability of mass media, people might be unconciously overwhelmed by commercials which display captivating fashion pieces  by touching the smart phone, watching TV or even walk on the street. Therefore, the repetitive slogan and remarkable logo of some famous brands are planted into their brains. Not only young people but also elderly people are the target of advertising agencies. Another explanation is their desire for social acceptance that drives them into  buying well reputed and expensive to show off and post their stunning pictures on social media like Facebook, etc,. to attract more attention and admiration. Lastly, famous brand ‘s popularity and high cost are often supposed to associate with the high-qualified items so consumers often flick into to purchase the well-known brands.\nNonetheless, as I believe this trend is largely detrimental to this country’s tradition and culture. Because a country’s history and customs have a strong tie to the existence of domestically produced goods . If the endless development of world-renowned brands continues, these famous items will expel the locally made products from commodity market, thus the disappearance of domestic product, lead to the economic crisis in the future. Given the dominance of the internationally famous brands, this will create the clothing styles difference in poverty and wealth, leading to the background discrimination.\nTo summarize,  the well-known commodities have a negative influence in domestically made products consumption, society and economic rate of a country due to the excessive advertising.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da ro rang tra loi cau hoi va phat trien quan diem cua minh ve yeu cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries today, the eating habits and lifestyles of children are different from those of previous generations. Some people say this has had a negative effect on their health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"We are observing the young generation who have made plenty of changes in every aspect of life. Some are inventive and meaningful but some are not really accepted by their predecessor especially about their eating instincts and lifestyles. In my opinion, I prefer to not decide if these changes really do harm to their health and stay neutral because I see both of advantages and drawbacks of this issue. \n\nOn the one hand, in many developed countries, the young especially teenagers are consuming too much fast foods that contain vast amount of sugar, additives, chemical colors but low nutrients instead of vegetables and proteins which is conventionally prepared. This has led to the rising number of people having obesity and diabetes. And I won't deny that it is clear there are a deterioration in health of nowadays generation. Also, some kids are likely to stay indoors more than their former generation and stick to video games and computers. Furthermore, staying up late at night and waking up late are the common habits of today's teenagers because of their school tasks, deadlines or maybe just a chat with their friends. \n\nHowever, the young today are not always careless about their health and their life. Trends such as eating organic products, becoming vegetarian are set up by many young persons to raise the awareness of healthy body and acquiring a longevity in their life. Clubs of sport are established more and more by youngsters to earning a good shape and good health state. What is more, they become activists who give helps not only for people at their age but also the elders who want to become healthy to approach to many health instructions and helpful information about medic and ways to protect health. And despite having a busy life, some people are trying to find their own way to playing sports and eating rationally. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that though the changes that the modern generation has made may be not really suitable for the previous generation, they are just a justification to the society. So they must have weak spots and strengths that we need to considerate properly\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dua ra ca hai mat cua van de va dua ra quan diem ca nhan cua minh ve van de nay.

Students need to get good scores to get into a good colleges and universities. But also higher education is very expensive and students need to do part time industry or job to collect enough money for their college or university fee. Accordingly, sometimes parents force their children to adopt those subjects in which child has no interest.This also creates load or stress on the student's mind.\n\nHowever, This is a positive development because working hard from the beginning makes them pre-mature to tackle the every situation. They do not coddle in any violence and crime. This is because they do not have time for such unfruitful activities. If they task hard in the early years they will develop their knowledge and personality, will have a happy and pleased life.\n\nIt is a negative development because it leads to stress and duty. Sometimes, students cannot balance between struggle and leisure time, which leads to boredom. Also, students face failures or cannot cope up with the pressure and their minds divert to suicidal tendencies, because they are forced to choose a course against their wishes and aims.\n\nOverall, It can be concluded that education is a very important part of the life, but if we pressurised children to do it at a young age, they do not afford that much stress and hardship. So, it affects negatively to their life and mental abilities.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi du yeu cau cua de bai voi viec neu ro ca hai mat tich cuc va tieu cuc khi ap luc tren hoc sinh va sinh vien ngay cang gia tang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, some children have an unhealthy lifestyle, and both schools and parents are in charge of solving this.\"\nEssay:\n\"First of all, the starting point of having an unhealthy lifestyle is how much care the child takes care of himself, because ıf she or he does not think about their health then they will do the things, which are unhealthy. For instance; spending too much time on  the computer, having unbalanced diet, addictions and not enough sleeping. Parents have a high impact on their children's health, because families are role models for their children, and children start acting similar as their family, because this is what they see. Also, children lifestyle depends on their family decisions. For instance; when the parents divorce, therefore, this will affect their child psychology. \n\nSchools also have a high effect on children's health in a good and bad way, but these effects are a little bit different than the family does. Schools mostly affect the mental part, which is psychology, because of exams, teacher pressure, too much future thinking and friendship issues. However, schools have a good effect as well. In some schools they have some classes, which will affect the children's lifestyle. For example; wellness and fitness, culinary, this is very important, because this may build up the children's diet, future planning, this course helps the children about preparing the future life. \n\nBasically, this is not just about parents and schools, it is also about the children self care, because family and school can just show the way but they cannot change it. Children have to see this with their own.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, noi dung de cap da tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai ve van de mot so tre em co loi song khong lanh manh va vai tro cua phu huynh va truong hoc trong viec giai quyet van de nay.

This essay examines both types of views, and I will give my perspective below.\n\nFirstly, Anyone cannot certain that who lives in space. Also, try to touch with something strange species is dangerous because I said, nobody sees them and has no information about them. If that situation has come true, there is no one will charge about that it is a too huge problem to human society so, it is completely wrong that try to touch with ailean. Individuals in Earth, they do not want to take a big risk.\n\nSecondly, on the other hand, it has a bright side also. For example, if we can find an alien and they are friendly with Earth, people would live a better world because maybe they give to a human about their uninnovated technology. Also, economical aspects, researching and development can make a lot of job opportunities for people. That R&D organisation such as NASA needs good manpower obviously  because they keep going their work.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by a local newspaper named 'BULLET TIMES' in 2018 approximately 80% of respondents answered 'agree' to question 'Do you agree with a project that tries to touch with other life forms in space?' This result means people live on the Earth, they would like to touch with ailean and they wondering a space.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, researching and development need to human life because it will give a lot of advantages more than disadvantages. I always imagine living on Mars.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n1. Doc de bai ky truoc khi bat dau viet va dam bao rang ban hieu dung nhung gi duoc yeu cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Drug abuse is becoming more and more common in many countries. What are some of the problems associated with drug abuse, and what are some of the possible solutions?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, people have completely normalised the intake of toxic substances for leisure. The problem with this is that most of them are highly addictive converting the consumer into an addict. It is clear that  increasing the number of drug addicts in a community also rises the percentage of criminals in the population. Overall, there is a lot of work that could be done in order to manage this issue. \n\nIt is common to observe some dramatic increases in vandalism in big cities, where in most  cases drugs are involved. During the last years in most of the big ,capitals violent crimes had increased dramatically when individuals are under drug effects, therefore this is making them completely dependent. On the other hand, there are also cases of street aggression between drug dealers who are not addicts but promote  substance addiction.\n\nHowever, there are many ways society could address this problem in a more effective way. One of them would be more drug education from a young age and make understanding what are the effects on  their body.  For example, schools could include some visits to rehab centres since It is important to create awareness of what are the consequences of drug consumption. It is also clear that governments need to invest more in those rehabilitation centres and health professionals, in order  to help addicts to recover. \n\nTo conclude, the normalisation of drug addiction not only promotes more violence  but also gives a bad example to young generations. It is important to address this from an early education point to make sure the youth is aware of the deadly consequences of it. Increasing the accessibility of rehab centres would be a benefit for populated cities where addiction is more common.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da phan tich van de tieu cuc lien quan den su gia tang su dung ma tuy va cung da de cap den nhung van de va giai phap co the co de quan ly van de nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people argue that capital punishment is good for a country. To what extent do you agree or\ndisagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Crime rates have been on the rise in the past decades, despite the culprit aware of the consequences he shall face for the offence committed by him.It is often argued that, capital punishment is beneficial for the well being of the nation and the citizens attached to it.I strongly concur with the fact that capital punishment should be improvised.\n\nTo begin with, punishments are essential for maintaining peace throughout the country.People are familiar with the law and order of their nation and if the law is broken, it usually means that injustice has taken place and harmony is being disturbed.Punishing a culprit makes the fear vanish from the minds of innocent people.For instance, Ajmal Kasab, a terrorist was killed in the attacks and peace was finally restored.\n\nOn the other hand, offence rates define the character of a country. Having said this, no matter how developed or developing a country is, if the crimes committed are increasing every year it reflects a bad character of the country to the world. This leads to the downfall of the economy and many other global factors are affected. For example, tourists avoid such places where they don't feel safe or places which have a bad image in the world.This ultimately leads to the loss of economy. Hence, executing a criminal for a harsh crime and preparing several punishments according to the weightage of crimes should be done.\n\nTo summarise, I strongly believe that capital punishments should be a part of law and order of the country as they will surely help maintaining peace, harmony and bring discipline to the people in the country.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cau hoi duoc dua ra trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe the best way to reduce  the number of accidents on the road is to further limit the speed of the vehicle. Others think there are better ways to tackle this issue. Discuss both the views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Does limiting the  speed of the vehicle reduce accidents?This is the most debatable issue as few  are in favour of controlling the speed of  automobiles,while others argue that  there are a plethora of ways to solve this problem.I believe various measures can be taken by the government to tackle the above issue.This essay shall  further discuss both  views with relevant examples in detail.\n\nOn the one hand, from the perspectives of people who think limiting the speed reduces accidents thinks so because  most of the dreadful incidents on the road occur due to uncontrolled speed.Youngsters are attracted to thrilling experiences and try to impress  their friends by  driving high speedy cars .Hence, they land up in unavoidable  circumstances. For Instance, studies on  the car accidents done in a survey in Mumbai depicts clearly that most of the mishaps are due to overspeeding.Therefore, it is believed that decreasing the speed limits on the roads will deter  accidents.\n\nOn the other hand,some folks  argue that only controlling the speed will not solve the problem and various measures can be taken to alleviate by the government.Firstly, unfortunate incidents occur when a person is drunk and drives his vehicle.Furthermore, accidents are most commonly done  by an inexperienced driver.For example,famous Bollywood celebrity Salman khan was stuck in a case of drunk and drive in the initial days  of his career.Henceforth, stricter enforcement of rules for issuing the driving licence and levying heavy penalty on the drunk drivers are few solutions which the government can enact upon.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe, enforcing strict rules for issuing the driving licence and charging drunk drivers will solve the problem of accidents and just reducing the speed limit will not be helpful.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, yeu cau de bai duoc tra loi mot cach du day.

Some people think free public service must be a obligate in a part of high school schedule for example working for a charity, helping older people or teaching sports to younger generation. I agree that these kind of application must be obligatory for  the high school learners.\n\nFirstlyt being a collective is a very important issue. Nowadays people dont help each other enough. If goverment make it compulsory for high school. Students are learn it very earlier ages. Being a good and sensitive society is very crucial. People should help the people who are need it. Moreover some people really need a help if we dont help them who are going to help us when we need a help.\n\nSecondly when we help to somebody we really feel like a human. People only exist when he or she part of the some society. For example when i help to somebody i really feel alive.\n\nThirdly helping somebody benefits our pshycology so much. When i feel down i try to help other people it increases my mood. \n\nOn the other hand forcing  people to  this kind of issue sometimes can be harmfull for their educational program. Every students should have to freedom of choice. We have to let people choice what they want. Furthermore if goverment decide what to do for high school they decide for every citizens\n\nIn conclusion, free public service must be obligate because of the being a collective is a very crucial.\n\nAlso to feel like human it is really important.

Others say that there are more important environmental problems.\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Some people hold the view that our recent main environmental trouble is the loss of many species of plants and animals, while others think that there are more critical environmental problems. While I think plants and animals extinction is one of the main environmental problems, I still believe that there are many problems in our environment which are also important.\n\nI  understand why some people hold the belief that  species extinction is the most important environmental problem. The main point for this is that the social media these days give people many information about endangered species. In addition, many people know that losing any kind of plants or animals can break the food chain, which forms life on earth. By gathering information for many sources which only concern about plants and animals can lead people to the thought that species loss is the biggest problem in the environment. \n\nNevertheless, I would argue that there are many environmental problems that are more important than species loss for several reasons. The first point is that the declination of natural resources. This can be seen in many Western countries that they often have wars because of oil needs. The second point is that many people all around the world today are deprived of freshwater. This is because the more developing the industry is, the more polluted the water is. \n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that the loss of many species of plants and animals is an important problem, I am of the opinion that there are more important environmental problems that people need to concern.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da trinh bay lap luan ve hai quan diem trai nguoc ve van de moi truong, bao gom quan diem rang mat cac loai thuc vat va dong vat la van de chinh va quan diem rang co nhieu van de moi truong khac quan trong hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is shown that many criminals have a low level of education. Some people argue that the best way to reduce crime is to educate criminals in prison to help them find jobs when they leave prison. \nDo you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Studies show that many offenders are not well-educated. For this reason, some people suggest the best way to lower crime is to give criminals the chance to receive enough education while in prison. I agree with this statement to some extent, but I would argue that this is the best way to reduce crime rate.\n\nOn the one hand, it is hard for people who have not been educated well to get a decent job, let alone for those with criminal records. These people find it hard to make a living therefore become an instable factor to the society. Moreover, with limited education, people might not realize that such behaviors are against the law. For example, underage youths perhaps do not know that shoplifting is considered as an illegal behavior because they have not been told or learned so. It can hence be suggested that by providing proper education to these people, crime rate can be reduced.\n\nOn the other hand, there are numerous lawbreakers who have obtained good education. News of high-intelligence crime cases are common these days. People therefore argue that low education background may have been affecting the rising crime rate, yet it is definitely not the decisive element for there are various causes that may motivate a criminal act. By comparison, it would be more effective and efficient for governments and other related departments to strengthen supervision and apply a more severe punishment on illegal activities.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that governments should attach more attention to education in prison to offer help and prepare the culprits for the life after being released, we must not overestimate the effectiveness of this hence other related measures should be taken in order to lower the crime rate.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi cau hoi cua de bai:\n- Bai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, tuc la xac dinh rang nhieu toi pham co trinh do giao duc thap va de xuat viec giao duc toi pham trong tu nhu mot cach giam toi pham.\n\nMo rong y tuong:\n- Bai viet cua ban da mo rong y tuong ve vai tro cua giao duc trong viec giam toi pham bang cach de cap den su kho khan trong tim viec lam va tai hoa nhap xa hoi cua nhung nguoi khong co trinh do giao duc cao.

There are several reasons behind this growth and some solutions could be drawn in order to solve these problems.\n\nMany factors can be considered for this issue, to begin with, financial problems. Nowadays a huge number of new-married couples do not have financial stability due to various reasons which is one of the most effective obstacle for them. Despite the mentioned factor, governments can control this trouble by employing some effective approaches. One of the most significant key that governments can apply, is motivating couples by setting child benefits, for instance, financial help for couples to become landlords.\n\nAnother reason that gives a rise to this couples’ decision, is the responsibility of being parents. these days couples prefer to spend time together and live in pleasure rather than upbringing children. Many different measures can be considered in order to resolve this hurdle. Firstly culture creating can have a major effect on the mindset of young couples. Also governments can encourage adolescents to become parents by using different ways, foe example, employing media to encourage them and supporting new-married couples.\n\nBy the way of conclusion, despite the mentioned factors that prevent couples to bring children, many answers could drawn for those difficulties which the main responsibility of solving existent issues like supporting couples and helping them financially, is on the governments.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response la mot trong nhung tieu chi cham diem quan trong nhat trong ky thi IELTS Writing.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Even though doctor advice more people to get more exercise, many old people do not get enough exercise.\n\nWhat are the reasons for it and what are the solutions?\"\nEssay:\n\"Some older community avoid doing exercise, knowing that doing a physical workout is good for both body and mind. Also, many doctors advise people to exercise as much as possible however, society do not follow the instructions of medical examiners. There are several reasons associated with this trend that will be discussed in the upcoming essay with some relevant solutions.\n\nInitially, despite some doctors advising a sum of people to training, they do not activity at all, which appears as a possible cause. After all, there is another reason that a number of population adopt a poor lifestyle into their lives, even though it is not at all beneficial to their health, elders show a disinclination for their exercises. Moreover, in overcrowded cities, the elderly rarely have the opportunity to workout. For example, due to the growing population of big cities like Mumbai and Delhi, safe roads have become very scarce and, as well as weak eyesight and bones are the reasons for an inactive lifestyle that cannot be overlooked.\n\nBe that as it may, appropriate steps need to be taken to get rid of this problem. For example, young children and students should be taught the importance of exercising and playing sports from school time itself, so that they can make themselves physically fit from an early age. \n\nIn addition, the government should take some steps to curb the growing traffic and competition in the densely populated city. For example, the Delhi government brought an odd-even scheme  which is a traffic rationing measure to reduce road congestion and pollution levels in 2015.\n\nIn conclusion, in my opinion, every human being should make a little change in their lifestyle and training, which will keep their body healthy, and also make young children aware of the benefits of physical activities from their parents and teachers.  In addition, the government should take new measures to control the increasing traffic gridlock.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nEssay cua ban da de cap day du den cac yeu cau cua de bai bang cach dua ra cac nguyen nhan va giai phap lien quan den van de cua nguoi gia khong co du tap the duc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Is online studying better than offline studying?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many people believe that online study is better than offline study. Personally, I totally agree with this view.\n\nThe main reason for studying online is that it provides a flexible schedule and environment for students and teachers. Studying online helps PEOPLE to avoid commuting to class, which means less time IS spent on the bus and more study time sitting on your couch. You do not have to worry about going to school or university in poor conditions like snowstorm, heavy rain and skipping a significant lesson. In fact, when learning online, you chose your own learning platform that better fit your needs. It could be your bedroom, your study, your street café, or your local gym.\n\nAnother reason why online learning is better than traditional learning is that it provides the opportunity for individuals to build valuable life and professional skills. For instance, the independent study aspects of distance learning can help students improve their time management skills and self – study skills because when learning online at home, you ought to concentrate on the lesson and take note of that without checking with the teacher. In addition, online learning also offers a range of platforms by which students and teachers communicate with each other, including email, web chat, and video conferences. As a consequence, with online learning, students can gain the technical skills required in their future careers.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that online learning is more effective than traditional studying for the reasons set out above.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi day du phan cau hoi cua de bai va giai thich ro rang quan diem cua minh.

Describe the skills a person needs to be a good parent.\"\nEssay:\n\"Schools are the foundation of learning for future life and must prepare individuals for the challenges they will face in their upcoming life stages. I agree with the idea that schools must teach every young student how to be good spouses and parents. \n\nNowadays, several teenagers struggle with relationships and eventually with parenthood as they come from broken homes. Due to increasing divorce and separation rates, young individuals have difficulties understanding how to be good parents, since they themselves do not get the affection and protection of stable guardians. At such times schooling can be a good medium of training modern day youth about ideal parenting practices. \n\nSchools must teach kids that compassion, patience and unconditional love are some key values of being a good parent. To be a successful parent, the Gen-Next must learn to be good listeners and must develop problem solving and multi-tasking skills. These capabilities help them cope with stressors and demands of child rearing and facilitate the upbringing of their infants. \n\nFor instance, educational curriculum could include activities like caring for a pet, so that children learn to care for another living being, or even games similar to monopoly, that will teach them to handle finances and run household chores. Such mock assignments can help adolescents inculcate necessary values.\n\nThus, a mix of formal education through institutionalized teaching as well as grooming at home can help the youth become capable parents. \"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi day du cau hoi cua de bai va cho thay quan diem cua minh.

Although, the viewpoint has opponents which mostly rely on such arguments that the life is given just once, thus it should be fulfilled with diverse experience. The essay will discuss both viewpoints and the author's personal opinion will be provided in the conclusion. \n\nOne the one hand, having  leisure which overlaps with  death or heavy injuries could arise from mental disorders or just boring life. In the modern highly globalised world, where most every pleasure of life can be picked and consumed, playing with death is considered  extraordinary.

All in all, frequent risk-taking often leads to deterioration of health, with possible cardiovascular and mental issues.\n\nOn the other hand, risking in all dimensions is highly praised among clerks, who spent most their lives in the open space or in a glass-box office. The top-notch financial periodicals, The Financial Times have been publishing a special \"Books of the year\" list, which mostly comprise of fiction about detectives, spies and explorers, and which is highly beloved by bankers. Thus, a desire to adventures and risks could be easily traced among the population stratum, since just in books they can live that risky experience, adding it gradually offline.\n\nFinally, it can be concluded that venture should be taken responsibly, with an outlook for an existing family, for example, while severe extreme , such as mountain climbing, even could lead to death.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da cung cap du thong tin de dap ung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More children in developed countries are becoming overweight. This is a serious problem for wealthy countries.\n\nDiscuss some causes and effects of this problem. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Obesity is one of the distinguished problem faced by developed countries, according to a few surveys conducted worldwide. Furthermore, the percentage of children, between 4-14 years, suffering from overweight is particularly higher when compared to the rest of the population. In this essay, I shall discuss some major reasons along with the impacts of it.\n\nThere are many entities which play a vital role in a substantial increase in obese children. Nowadays, the dietary habits in rich nations gradually changed over the years. Especially in countries like the United States, London and also few Asian territories, consumption of unhealthy products, such as packaged foods, fast-food, carbonated cool drinks and desserts with higher sugar levels, increased. In addition, another potential cause is due to the abundant availability of money in consequence with lack of proper time. Parents work hard round the clock to provide a comfortable life for their family; however, because of their high wages, they are at ease to afford excess food. Moreover, the trending culture of grocery shopping in high-end markets, for example, Walmart, lure adults and children in purchasing unnecessary edible items, which eventually increase intake, followed by corpulence.\n\nConsequently, the problems faced by such children keep developing over time. Predominant ones among many others are, serious health issues, for instance, high cholesterol level, heart diseases, hormonal changes, PCOD in women, skin complications, hair loss and many other vital worries. In fact, depression is one common struggled issue by people with any of these health troubles. However, everything can be put to control with proper diet, physical exercise and medication under proper professional guidance.\n\nIn conclusion, identifying this problem and understanding the negative effect caused by minimalistic actions throughout childhood could ruin one's healthy life. It is high to start improvising it through baby steps and succeed in every aspect of their career.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nVe mat noi dung, bai viet cua ban da tra loi day du yeu cau de bai va da phan tich cac nguyen nhan va hau qua cua van de beo phi o tre em trong cac quoc gia phat trien.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Should private schools receive government funding?\nGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Schools are an essential component for the all-around development of children; however, is it necessary for the government to invest in private schools. Even though governmental institutes need a decent amount of money to operate, I find the notion to fund private academies completely flawed since they do not charge students with high fees but they also gain sufficient profit by charging for extra-curricular activities.\n\nMost of the government-owned schools are deficient in budget. This is because these schools are backward in terms of infrastructure which requires money for renovation, and the authorities charge very little fees from students. This in turn makes it necessary for the government to provide funds as they are unable to generate enough income and thus, it is required to keep institutes functional.\n\nContrarily, non-governmental institutes charge high fees for children. To elaborate more, private schools provide amenities along with surplus facilities at the cost of extra money which is willingly paid by most of the parents for the future of their kids. As evidence, there is a large difference between the fees structure of private and public schools. Had these private schools not been charged this much fee, there could be a need to provide funds. However, unnecessary money is already being paid to them.\n\nIn addition to high tuition fees, extra money is charged for various other activities in these private schools. Firstly, parents are insisted to pay admission fees to secure a seat as there are limited slots available. Secondly, students are forced to buy books and uniforms from school only which provides these schools extra profit. Furthermore, there are made to pay examination fees, welfare amounts, and much more.\n\nTo recapitulate, two main points are mentioned in this essay: reasons to provide funds to public schools, and reasons not to invest in private institutes.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da trinh bay cac lap luan rat tot ve viec cap tai tro cua chinh phu cho truong tu.

Which out of the two – rural area or urban area – is the best place ? Although some individuals opined to feel the peace of  nature, because of a better lifestyle and social network, I find the  latter view best.\n\nA school of thought insists that it is a better way to experience the tranquillity of the environment. As there are no natural beauty places such as rivers, mountains, farmlands, forests, and so on in the metropolis because of industrialization and urbanisation, whereas people who are living at outskirts location can enjoy the natural beauty and live the hustle-free lifestyle. Consequently, it will help to calm their mind and eventually good for physical health and mental as well. A survey revealed that 20% population of Australia shifted back to suburbs from downtown to live a peaceful life.\n\nContrarily, there will be a better facility for all the citizens. Plenty of amenities are available in the large cities such as a better education system for children, wide job opportunity for youth, advanced health system, convenient transport system, and so on, thereby, these all facilities will help the residents to live trouble-free life in many ways. Amit Kumar, for instance, One of my friends, now having a good salary package after switching job  a number of times, as multiple job opportunities were available for him in a metro city.\n\nBesides multiple facilities for the people, it will help to enhance the friendship circle. A large number of people are residing in the big cities, they will get an opportunity to meet and interact with a different type of personalities and culture. It will help them to broaden their social circle and learn different type of skills. As a result, no one will suffer from loneliness or depression. \n\nTo conclude, admittedly, a person can experience better surroundings; however, for improvement of living standards and social circle, I support to settle in the city for long term.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung du yeu cau cua de bai, tuy nhien, van co the co mot so diem can cai thien:\n\n- Trong phan mo dau, ban neu ra hai quan diem khac nhau nhung lai khong dua ra suy luan cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More developing countries are being given aid by international organisations to help them in their development plan. Some people argue that financial aid is important but others suggest that practical aid and advice are more important. Discuss both view and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Multinational cooperations give development aid to many second-world countries with the aim of promoting their improvement plans. Although supplying monetary assistance can uplift countries' economic situation and it is able to induce to decline unemployment rate I believe that practical support and receiving advice on sustainable development may assist them to find out better solution for their problems and those states may show efficient performance in every sector.\nOn the one hand, ensuring development assistance to those nations that are on the way of progress would assist them to use the money to formulate such policies that can be beneficial in terms of economic growth and decreasing unemployment problem to a certain extend. In order to eliminate economic barriers which can bring about weakening developing countries' improvement those states may spend foreign aid on underdeveloped sectors on the purpose of providing to generate more income that underpin sustainable development through rising of countries' total earnings. Along with, recovering economic situation may create condition for small enterprenuers to take loans with the intention of establishing a succesful business which leads to decreament in unemployment rate. As a result, developing countries may spur their economic growth through overseas aid. For examlpe, In Egypt vast majority of small business owners set up a business by the help of international aid. However, I believe that this is not effective method because these states increase their dependence on international entites and they would not try to work on their development.\nOn the other hand, advising those states on how to form policies and what techniques should be followed to carry out them efficiently can result in coming up with better solution and efficient performance in different sectors. If transnational organizations explain the method of successful development to those nations, they try to learn their problems and bring about novel way as they investigate states' matter in depth and take on responsibility for solving their challanges on their own, as well as eliciting of  immediate concerns and dealing with them in distinctive sector causes development in those sectors. As a consequence, without being depended on any organizations, progressing countries can solve their problems owing to searching fundamental problems in their economy. For instance, 50% of less developed countries are provided by advisory services of World Bank with the aim of performing better improvement. I believe this approach is better as it teaches them independence to grow.\nIn conclusion, although giving development aid to progressing countries by multinational entites can help them to use this money their development by providing training on making efficient policies might be more effective approach.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response trong bai viet cua ban kha tot khi ban da doi chieu ca hai quan diem va ro rang dien dat y kien cua minh ve su can thiet cua ca viec cung cap tro cap tai chinh va ho tro thuc te va dua ra lap luan cho y kien cua minh.

The preservation of cultural values would highly important to the countries which are relying largely on tourism income. \n\nIn the contrary, the world is constantly enriching with new and effective engineering and architectural concepts. Thus new constructions could be planned to attain great level of effectiveness and space management. Moreover, it would be ideal to use the latest technologies and designs in new constructions rather than adhereing to old designs. The said notions is also very crucial aspect to be looked at considering the significance of space management to cater to the demands of the growing population. \n\nIn conclusion, it is agreed that preserving the ancient values when constructing the new buildings are imparative. However, the said practice should be limited to the areas which has significant ancient values while in other cases to use the most updated technology and designs.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da phan tich day du ca hai mat cua van de va tra loi dung cau hoi duoc dat ra trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that the teenage years are the happiest time of most people's lives. Others think that adult life brings more happiness, in spite of greater responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Some say that youngsters can enjoy their life to the fullest, while others opine that adulthood is the most charming period, even\nthough some duties are to be fulfilled. This essay will argue that although grown-up people enjoy family support, I reckon that young age is the most happening time when teenagers can relish the\nfreedom.\nOn one hand, matured individuals have emotional support of their family, resultantly they can share their feelings and troubles with their spouse. Moreover, life partners also act as an helping hand in order\nto provide financial support. It is often seen that the biggest enemy of an individual is its loneliness. Therefore, motivating partner and\nmature offsprings complete a human being. To epitomize, a research conducted by Oxford University revealed that grown-up individuals who are not married often lead isolated lives. However, I ponder that\nyouth can have more pleasure owing to more liberty.\nOn the other hand, in teenage age children are not required to fulfil family commitments, consequently they can easily migrate from one place to another in search of better future. Juveniles are not worried\nabout undertaking family responsibility, as a result they fully enjoy their present life without considering future savings. Furthermore, guardians are always available in order to guide their immature child\nand to eclipse their mistakes. To exemplify, a research conducted by colleges revealed that teenage age is the most delighted age due to less pressure.\nTo conclude, despite adults can have mental and economic support from their families, youngsters are more happy as they are free to live their life. thus it is lack of responsibility that make adolescent joyous.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da dua ra hai quan diem ve chu de va phan bien ro rang cho ca hai quan diem.

In some nation, the companies would like to hire the experienced person, rather than other folks. In my opinion, it is unfair for the knowledgeable man got less preference whether they have innovative, and in this essay, I would shed light on both in details.\n\nThere are several reasons why some countries, competent have more benefits. The region,  like India, most of the Multi national plants provide the jobs to those who had at least 2 years experience and also pay the high salary. Sometimes, Novice person loss the opportunity because of less experience. Moreover, If they hire by someone, but definitely on low wages, either they have more skills and productive than experts. For an example, According to the survey, which is conducted by The Indian University found that economy level has been reduced in last year, because the work followed by experienced guys with traditional method.\n\nOn the contrary side, the country’s such as Canada followed by the different criteria. This country always gives a chance to recently graduated students to show their skills. Therefore, the economy level of this country always on the peak point. For an instance, In 2019, the Canada offers around 85000 permanent residency to the immigrants of other nationalities who have a more technical brain.\n\nTo put in a nutshell, I pen down and say that more expertise have lots of options, but the government should give opportunity to the youngster, so that they can improve the methods in a creative way.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban dap ung ro rang yeu cau cua de bai va cho rang viec uu tien kinh nghiem hon kien thuc la bat cong doi voi nhung nguoi co kien thuc gioi nhung thieu kinh nghiem.

However, a fair amount of people believe that threat of flora and fauna extinction is the main issue of environmental problem but others say that there are more paramount atmosphere obstacles.

For example, when pretatory animals  like Tigers and Lions are eliminating while increase the large amount of herbivores. This situation will affect the farm yield as animal like rabbit, pig, and deer as a result, these animals will eat up all farm produce consequendly, this trend can lead to food scarcity all around the world.\n\nOn the other hand, climate change is the fundamental threat of habitat headache such as pollution, green house gas effect and global tempreature are rising.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Unhealthy food has negative effect on both individuals and on the society they live in.  Some people think that the government should tax the unhealthy food while others say that fat tax is unfair an unnecessary.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In the fast-moving world, people don't have enough time to spend on eating. The importance of cooking healthy foods is decreasing. Many people just want to fill their stomach rather than having healthy and sensible eating. In order to make it habitual, some people think to impose levy on these unhealthy foods, therefore the effect on individual as well as on the society can be controlled. This essay goes through the for and against of tax implementation. \n\nOne group of people strongly stands to tariff fast foods like sandwiches, burgers, packed foods, canned drinks, etc. As it affects the health of the growing children, they came up with the one possible solution, like that of a similar measure had been taken on vanishing/reducing plastic usage in society. Eye problems, insomnia, obesity, lazy attitude are the problems mostly find within the children at their very early age, because of giving fast foods to them. Not only children but also the grown-ups, suffering from many health issues, like food and work imbalance, fertility problems for both women and men (surprisingly), overweight, digestion problems etc. I can depict this with a real case example. A child is very adamant and sticks to a branded noodle. He wants to have it almost daily. As a result, he got digestion problem which led him to a major kidney operation. So, if 'The fat tax' has been implemented, the price of these unhealthy foods’ increases, and in such a way that the consumption decreases. Followed by that the future society will be health-conscious and disease-free generation. \n\nOn the other hand, another group of people oppose the implementation of the fat tax. These people are mostly the wholesalers, salesperson, mall owners, food and beverage producers, who are all money-minded, I can say. when the price of these products increases, their sales and profit decreases. They will face economic kind of problems. As a result, it may affect the prevailing economic situations. \n\nTo conclude the discussion, I suggest my opinions here. Children are getting attracted towards the Ad campaigns which virtually gives a feast to them. And therefore, either the telecast timing should be rescheduled or that particular company have to pay some amount as telecast fee to the government on hourly basis. Youngsters can create awareness regarding this issue. The Food safety department should tighten rules still more.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai tieu luan cua ban da dua ra hai quan diem trai nguoc nhau ve viec ap thue doi voi thuc pham khong lanh manh.

What are the advantages and disadvantages for both individuals and companies to shopping online?\nDiscuss both sides and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"For the last couple of years, online shopping has become the favourite purchasing method of many customers, mostly because of the restraint order during the pandemic and its convenience. To give people multi-dimentional views about online shopping, this essay will provide some benefits and downsides that this method possesses and conclude with a personal opinion.\n\nPurchasing products via social media can bring plenty of advantages to both customers and retailers. First of all, online shopping can reduce a considerable amount of time for individuals. For instance, if a person decides to use the traditional way of shopping, they will go to the store, look for  suitable products among the shelves, and purchase them, thus it will take them a lot of effort and time in order to find the goods that meet their expectation. This is entirely opposite to online shopping, which is extremely easy to buy any product. Secondly, especially for retailers, they can cut down many expenses through the social network. \n\nHowever, despite the benefits that this method brings, there are some disadvantages that people should be aware about. The quality of the products is not guaranteed to satisfied the customers. Moreover, the confidential protection is another factor that customers should consider before deciding to purchasing through the social network.\n\nIn conclusion, every method have their own exemplaries and inauspiciousnesses, but I personally believe that the online shopping market will continue to grow in the future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da trinh bay hai mat cua mua sam truc tuyen - loi ich va bat loi cua viec mua sam truc tuyen cho ca nhan va doanh nghiep.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Living in a country where you have to speak a foreign language can cause serious social problems as well as practical problems. \n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is a common belief that people residing in foreign countries have lots of difficulties in both their social and practical life. However, I don’t agree with this opinion that thanks to the development of education and technology, individuals can easily get used to the living conditions in other nations.\n\nTo start with, social problems are not as serious as we all have thought. Foreigners always welcome people from other countries to come and live with them so that they can broaden their horizon about differences in cultures and lifestyles. Moreover, they are usually hospitable and cordial so it seems quite easy to have a talk and make friends with them. For example, when you come to Vietnam, people here are very enthusiastic, they are willing to answer any questions from you or even help you take a tour and understand more about their beautiful country. Additionally, unlike the past, humans nowadays have higher education and more experience, so that they have more awareness of language barriers, thus really appreciating foreigners’ effort to get acquainted with the life in their country. Particularly, some adversities for exchange students while studying in other countries were racism, misconception and discrimination, so they felt antipathy towards surrounding people and just wanted to segregate themselves from the community. But now, those problems have gradually disappeared and been replaced by the harmony with their foreign friends.\n\nBesides, difficulties in practical activities have not been too severe to be nervous. Thanks to the development of technology, residents in foreign countries can do everything by themselves without too much help from others. For example, with technical devices, when they want to find the correct directions, all they need to do is to search the location on Google map and receive instructions in their own language just in seconds. Furthermore, there are thousands of useful apps to learn languages, so they can try and improve their understanding and speaking skills of the common language of the countries they are living in. They have available environments to practice and enhance their abilities, so with some effort and their phones accompanying them, they can gradually adapt to other countries’ culture and people’s attitudes there. Thanks to that, they have opportunities to enhance their capacities day by day to become the most satisfied and best version of themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, from my perspective, I think that living in a foreign country and having to speak its national language are not as severe as we used to think thanks to the help of state-of-the-art education and modern technology.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet, ban da dap ung du yeu cau cua de bai va co lap luan ro rang voi tieu de de cho.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Lack of fresh water is becoming a global issue of increasing importance. What problems does this shortage cause? What measures could be taken to overcome these problems?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is thought by some people that there is an increasing depletion of fresh water across countries, and that it can raise many adversities. In my opinion, the health sector is particularly affected. To solve this issue, government and citizens must acknowledge this problem and its root cause, and act according to their responsibilities.\n\nFirstly, the major area that is affected by this loss is the health of the communities. This is due to the fact that water is an essential need of all human beings, it is used for drinking to sustain bodily functions, and to take a bath or wash hands to clean us from microorganisms. If clean water is decreasing, basic functions like those are disturbed, and a reduction of sanitation and hygiene level happened. We know that those can lead to diseases, namely infectious diseases. For example, clean uncontaminated water is necessary for making formula milk for babies, without it, babies are prone to contracting ailments such as diarrhea and malnutrition.\n\nThe solution for this is to create a collective effort between the government and the people. The government must create a task force consisting members of different backgrounds to create a solution that will tackle the root of the lack of the water. The main root, I believe, is the pollution of the sources of rivers and seas by industrial corporations. An example of solving this is the strict laws created by many nations to prevent spilling industrial wastes to open water. On the other hand, the individuals of the country must be aware that some of their actions, such as throwing trash in the body of waters, are also part of the problem. The example of this can be found in teaching children to put trash in trash cans in school.\n\nIn conclusion, the decrease of fresh water in all countries globally can cause an increase of infectious diseases. The measure to be taken is by making sure every parts of each countries aware of the problem and prevent further contamination of the scarce resource.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Yeu cau de bai da duoc phan anh dung: Bai viet cua ban da kha dap ung yeu cau de bai bang cach neu ro cac van de ma thieu nuoc gay ra va de xuat bien phap de giai quyet.\n\n- Giai thich day du cac phan cua nhiem vu: Bai viet cua ban da dap ung tot yeu cau de bai bang cach giai thich ro rang ve viec thieu nuoc gay ra nhung van de gi, dac biet la lien quan den suc khoe cong dong va lam giam muc do ve sinh.

Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"In this day and age, people have different visions about time and money. Some of them believe that having more money and less leisure time is better than low income and having more free time. From my perspective, people should work hard to earn more money which is a better than having more time with low salary because value of money bring us more benefits.\n\nAlthough people can spend more time to take care of themselves or enhance value of spiritual fife, having life with the low income and too much time is boring. Everything need money and life is not much comfortable if people don’t earn enough money to live. We can not hang out with friends or enjoy own pleasure and it is an easy way which leads stress. And in period when Covid-19 impact negatively on the national economy, senior student which have just graduated  could land in an impasse if they don’t find a job. Or having more free time could bring people bad emotions and negative thinks. People could take notice of something which nothing to pay attention. For instance, some invidual feel less confident when everybody around they have good work except him.\n\nOn the other hand, having more money and less free time is better. As an illustration, some invidual earn much money and spend time for his family hardly, so he will respect time when he can together with his family or friends. People can enjoy the service in the best way with corresponding money, this is a benefit of money. People can not have much time with family, but any time they are together, they feel satisfied and always keep beautiful memories.\n\nIn conclusion, having more money and less free time can bring convenience and prosperous for people.

You discuss both views of the topic and present your opinion clearly. However, some points need further development to strengthen your argument and fully address the question.\n\nThe first paragraph adequately introduces the two views, but it could benefit from a more coherent structure. Consider organizing your sentences more logically and clearly stating the two perspectives in separate sentences. This will make your introduction more focused and easier for the reader to follow.\n\nIn the body paragraphs, you provide arguments for both sides. However, the second paragraph could be expanded further. Instead of mentioning that having more free time can lead to negative emotions and comparisons to others, you could provide specific examples or evidence to support your point. This will make your argument more convincing and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.\n\nFurthermore, the second body paragraph lacks a clear topic sentence. It would be beneficial to start the paragraph with a clear statement that directly relates to the advantages of having more money and less free time. This will help guide the reader and provide a stronger organizational structure.\n\nIn the conclusion, you briefly summarize your main points and restate your opinion. However, a more thorough summary and a stronger connection to your main arguments would improve the conclusion. Consider rephrasing your concluding sentence to emphasize the benefits of having more money and less free time.\n\nOverall, while you do address the task prompt and express your opinion, further development and organization of your ideas is needed to strengthen your essay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe  that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligence Roberts.What is your opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"Artificially intelligent robots will take over the human workforce in the future. Although, all the easy skill jobs will be done by robots, but still some skillfull work will require human contacts. This essay will discuss why some jobs will still be undertaken manually. \n\nRobots may be replaced to carry forward the jobs that are not too complex and can easily perform without much involvement by humans.As it will be beneficial for multinational companies and industries to gain profits through artificial intellect instead of spending highly on hiring, training and employing the human. For instance, in may metropolitan cities the traffic personnel are replaced by an automatic traffic control system which is far more cost effective. In addition, this system works around the clock and require no holiday.\n\nFor these reasons computers and robots will be involved in human lives more frequently in the upcoming future.\n\nConversely, there are some skillfull jobs that are interdependent on human relations and emotions, and that this job cannot be handled by automated robots. Likewise, the jobs where the human mind, soul and his own natural brilliance is more crucial rather than only the profit conquered by the artificial brilliance. These jobs include psychology, education, medicines and some social jobs needed for the betterment of the society. All in all, robots cannot perceive human nature that has performed this social evolution since hundred and thousands of years ago. \n\nTo sum up, a significant number of jobs will be control of the artificial intellect in the future. Despite the fact that advanced technologies will take over the market; however I still believe that some sophisticated jobs will require human agility.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different\n\ncultures and ages together.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"Music is a tool by which people from different cultures and age groups can unify together, this is a common belief by some people. In my opinion, I strongly agree. \n\nFor many years, music was one of the criteria by which you can know and understand some people’s culture or background. For example, if you hear a particular melody, you can relate it to a specific group of people or culture. The music of South Egypt differs from the Mediterranean. On the other hand, the music of South Egypt is so close to the music of many African countries. Moreover, you can unify people under the music umbrella.\n\nHowever, you can find different kinds of music in the same country. Not only does each type identify  the environmental nature of these people, but also it reflects their culture and belonging. Today, I watched a concert for Mohamed Mounir, one of the most famous singers in Egypt. The orchestra contains musicians from different countries. The singer himself is Egyptian Nubian, however, the orchestra has people from 10 different countries. Some of them were from Germany, others were Arabs and, surprisingly, the solo violin musician was from Tokyo. Years back, Mounir used to make concerts in Berlin, although most of the attendees could not understand Arabic,  his concerts had been fully booked months before.\n\nMusic is an easy language that brings people together. For example, I myself enjoy French classical music a lot, but I cannot understand French well. Some instruments belong to a special culture more than others. The harp is a symbol of  ancient Egyptian music. On the other hand, the tambourine belongs to the Nubian and Sudanese cultures.\n\nTo sum up, In my opinion, we can use music to unify nations. The arts in general, is a great opportunity to dissolve the conflicts and differences between us. It makes us feel uniquely dissolved in each other.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cau hoi trong de bai va phat trien chu de mot cach chi tiet va hop ly.

However, as the resale price of these goods is low, they recover only a fraction of the original cost and hence end up putting in more money for purchasing the device. Spending too much money on new gadgets can put individuals under tremendous financial distress.\n\nSecondly, the compulsive urge to buy the latest version of gadgets is not good for the environment. When people update the devices frequently, a lot of older devices will end up in landfills. From there they will pollute the land and water. They could even emit harmful radiations.\n\nThirdly, most electronic gadgets have different operating procedures. Hence it becomes essential for the buyer to spend a significant amount of time to familiarize themselves with the new device. This wastes precious time that could be used for other useful purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the practice / habit of buying latest devices, mobile phones or laptops has a detrimental effect on the personal life and financial condition of an individual.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban rat tot ve mat nhiem vu va da tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things that we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives.\n\n\nWhich viewpoint do you agree with?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"To promote the business,companies choose effective ways to reach customers as publications.Many people believe that promotional adverts attract  people to purchase the commodity even those that are not useful to them.Some opine that those broadcast help us to introduce a new variety of stuff to improve their lifestyles.In my opinion, I agree with the statement.In the forthcoming paragraphs, I shall explain my point of view.\n\nFirstly, several studies have suggested that  literature, which remains the most effective means of increasing sales for many varieties, can manipulate customers into buying goods that they don't actually need because their bottom line is to uplift the overall sales for a company. For example, in the realm of cosmetics, once the new innovation became stagnant, companies started to move towards misleading marketing tactics to increase their sales, which differentiate the quality with little to no actual difference, in terms of day Vs night, men's Vs women's and kid's Vs adult's. It changes the whole narrative into having a personal product for each household, then having a common consumption trend.\n\nSecondly, it is observed that the recent rise in consumer behaviour studies, which focuses on the emotional element behind a purchase decision, has enabled varieties to manipulate buyers by forming stories that can tap into their feelings and emotions, and create desires that never existed. For instance, several luxury brands like Gucci and Ferrari create a sense of success and exclusivity around their products by using exotic locations and extremely attractive models in their commercials. It consequently creates a desire to get these limited products so that one can also become a part of these exclusive clubs.\n\nIn conclusion, I think advertisements do have the power to pursue us into buying unnecessary goods. We as consumers need to be more vigilant, and authorities need to regulate the advertisements more tightly to counter this issue.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Do you think it is better for students to work before their university study? Why? Use reasons and specific examples to support your choice.\"\nEssay:\n\"Critics said that students shouldn't work before enrolling in university as they will have plenty of time to do so sooner or later. I am strongly against  this affirmation for two reasons, firstly taking a gap year provides youngsterswith  a more thorough career-plan beforehand, and ,secondly it can propose an alternative plan for those who perform not so well at school .\n\nTo embark on, teenagers can make a better career plan following the internship. Realizing how cruel the workplace is only after they graduate, students have no clues on how to prepare themselves at school in an attempt to fit in the commercial world. For instance, they don't know how to excel the knowledge they learnt from school to the society. Additionally,  discovering the differences between reality and the classroom, it can serve as a driving force for striving for a better grade at school and thus offer a better job in future. \n\nApart from that, this can provide an exit plan for those who hate study. Not everyone likes learning, some may be just not suitable for it innately. Through the experiences of working, students with no interest in school can leave school earlier and stop wasting their time. Instead of doing something they may feel suffering and with no promising outcomes, they could explore more possibilities by trying something totally new. A typical case in point, Bill Gates, the founder of apple didn't finish university and still made a fortune afterwards through countless trials in the work setting.  \n\nTo conclude, by citing two reasons, as more proper career plans and more possibilities, I strongly encourage students to work before the commencement of college. I believe a gap year internship would definitely bring more good than harm to our students.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response: Trong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach dua ra quan diem rang hoc sinh nen lam viec truoc khi hoc dai hoc va dua ra hai ly do de ung ho quan diem cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It has been seen that these days, some workplaces tend to employ equal numbers of men and women workers. Do you think it is a positive or negative development.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is now a trend in multinational companies and large organizations to give equal roles to women employees in the workplace.  This is a very healthy initiative which has led to an increase in the number of women being employed and the numbers are now catching up with that of the male employees in such organizations.  In my view, this is a highly positive development which has got a plethora of merits for our nation.\n\nFirstly,  talent and hard work of any individual needs to be appreciated and awarded without any discrimination.  Such policies help organizations realize the potential of their employees and achieve their business goals faster.  For example, the turnaround story of Pepsico from crisis by choosing a non-board-member women to be their chief illustrates the point. \n\nSecondly, a recent study by the University of California on the workplace gender ratio showed that teams with an equal proportion of men and women tend to be more productive than those dominated by one gender. NASA, the most successful space exploration agency, uses the results of this study in structuring their teams and to plan even their interplanetary mission crews.   \n\nAlthough it is understandable that women are physically weak as compared to men and that they are not completely out of the age-old social stigma which makes them take up more responsibilities towards their families, they have made up for such negative factors by their sheer hard work and persistence.  So, women being treated and employed just like any other human being is one of the biggest revolutions which is happening in our times and it holds the key for the sustainable development of any nation in the world.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cau hoi trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships that people make? Has this been a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the last 10 years, technological advancement in the internet and multimedia has increased significantly and influences how people communicate and interact with others effectively and less costly without direct meet. In this essay, I will outline the advantages and disadvantages of these issues in our society.\n\nIt is true that people's interaction with others is no longer limited by distance, and in our daily work we can attend online training provided by our employer in real-time and it will minimize companies' budget to increase efficiency. In 2005 IBM save millions of dollars to enhance human resource quality by cutting expenses in travel and accommodation for their employees. Nevertheless, this method requires a corporation to prepare cutting-edge platforms and equipment which is relatively expensive, and companies with a limited budget such as small and medium enterprises do not have adequate resources to satisfy this requirement. Besides, the topics conveyed by the trainers sometimes do not understand clearly by the audience due to network disruption.\n\nOn the other hand, people can make new friends from different parts of the world through media social like Facebook and Instagram which enable them to know other countries' cultures and values. They also can share their knowledge and experience and obtain various information on business opportunities and scholarships overseas to pursue higher education, but this will cause a new problem if people do not choose wisely friends they know from social media. They will be victims of crimes like sextortion which occurred around the world several years ago and loss of money after transferring a lot of money to buy certain items by fake accounts.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that technological development facilitates us to interact with other people because much more efficient, cheaper and faster. However, we are also cautious regarding its risk when we meet new people on social media.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nVe phan Task Response cua bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi day du cau hoi cua de bai va phat trien y cua minh voi nhung vi du cu the.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people today are worried about ‘cybercrime’ such as hacking and identity theft. What problems does ‘cybercrime’ cause, and what solutions can you suggest for ordinary people and businesses to take?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is no  doubt, that the number of cybercrimes has been constantly rising over the last decade. The most obvious reason for this phenomenon is severe deficiency of secure software in comparison with malicious soft. In this essay I would like to discuss some outcomes and solutions for this issue.\n\nTo begin with, while IT-specialists unsuccessfully atepmt to catch up hackers, ordinary users scarely take benefits from existing software due to IT-illiteracy. Individuals browse suspicious web-sites and receive unsolicited messages without realizing probable consequences. As a result, they provide hackers with an acces to  personal data, such as name, bank account number or even chattings.Moreover,  victims of cybercrimes often face with psychological abusement, such as cyber bulling or exploitation. As for corporations, the main reason for being endangered is an increased number of persons with an acces to corporation's data. Particularly, each corporation with remote branches has to use share servers, and each computer with an authorized acces can be crashed. Finally, a remarkable ammount of data thefs occurs due to improper usage of official gadgets.\n\nOverall, some steps shoud be implemented in order to manage more relevant security politics. Firstly, goverments should shift theirs focuses onto development of legal framework in cyberspace.Some kind of management authority in privacy also might be created. Clear terms of investigations and conprehensible punishment politics would  trigger a sustaintial decline in cybercrime. Another one measure would be reinforcing of privacy politics among corporations. For instance, each employee who receives an access to corporation's data should be scrupulously testified in cyber security knowledge and skills. In addition, a prohibition ro use official gadgets for personal purposes might also reduce a number of random data thefts.\n\nTo conclude, I would say, that despite various causes for cybercrime, such measures, as creating privacy policy and reconsideration of privacy rules for users, might be highly effective in both categories.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban chu de chinh xac va da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai.

However, a fair amount of people think that it is bad to hold on to brutal in wild park. Nevertheless,  others think that zoological garden are most for significant for drilling and protection. Viewing from a general perspective, the essay discusses both viewpoints, I personally agree with the former opinion for the  following reasons. \n\nTo begin with, there are many reasons for this is illegal activity to keep wild animals in zoos. Firstly, this can affect to the beast irrefutably how they can not live to freedom life where cage as a result, they are lived only few square meter space compard to forest. Secondly, the animals put in captivity while they might aggressive as a consequent, they might be attacked who the guardian. For example, some species are bred while in captivity die the predators such as Tiger and Lion when release the forest.\n\nOn the other hand, Zoologocal garden is the best place for keeping brutal in order to avoid many things. Firstly, when the beast hold on to wild park the public have a chance to know and see about their lifestyle because the population never go to visit forest in order to learn about this. Secondly, the most important of the menagerie can help to presevation of some endangered fauna therefore, the researcher are able to do their higher studies in wild life such as documentary film. For example, in India have been saved some creachers in order to avoid extinction such as Tiger. \n\nTo conclude, this trend has both benefits as well as detrimental. In my opinion is the beast should not hold on to the menagerie because they can live to without any restriction in their own destination such ad wild. In , addition sometime the wild fauna will get stress and depression by human torture such as circus and exhibition.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTruoc het, bai viet cua ban da dua ra ca hai quan diem ve viec co nen cho dong vat vao so thu hay khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that professional athletes make good role models for young people, while others believe they don’t.\n\nDiscuss both these points of views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Every famous person's activity has an effect somewhere on other people. Some people say that professional players make good role models for the younger generation, while others think that this is not right. Through this essay I will discuss both of the points in detail and then will come to a reasonable conclusion comprising of my opinion.\n\nFamous players can play a vital role in the youth development. They are followed by many people, because of their reputation and hence their every action has a direct effect on their followers. For instance, the increasing change in fashion and the lifestyle of the youth, is caused by the specialist sports person because of their renowned status. Thus, it this clear that how important role they can play in order to alter the attitude of people.\n\nOn the other hand, there are people, who argue that this saying is not right, because they believe that every person is capable enough to make the difference between right and wrong. It is further added that, though, such distinguished players have the reputation and respect in society, but this does not mean that they must be followed in every moment of life. However, this is not always true, because it is difficult to control the youngster from adopting their style as a fan can do anything for his / her followers. Thus, this thought is refused because of such reason.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that professional sports persons can play a vital role in order to affect the lives of youth positively, because they have fans and followers everywhere.

But I do remember a time when I had to talk to a complete stranger, and as I remember it was around 5 years ago, on my very first trip to Ho Chi Minh City. It was just a short conversation, but I can still remember it quite well.\n\nI was a 20-year-old freshman back then, and I was unable to navigate my way to the HCMC University of Education where I was about to start studying. Back then Google Map’s wasn’t as popular as it is nowadays, so the only way I could figure out the way was by asking a local. So after hours of wandering around, I finally resorted to asking a lady who was selling noodles at a food cart near where I was standing. I asked the lady if she would be so kind to tell me the way to the HCMC University of Education and she kindly replied by pointing to the big building across the road and saying ’it’s over there’.\n\nThe university was being renovated back then, so I was unable to recognise it, but before I went off to study I decided to sit down and order some noodles from the old lady and have a chat with her. It turns out that she was also from Ninh Thuan, which is my hometown. So we ended up chatting for ages about our lives and about how and why we had come to HCMC.\n\nYou know, I think I found this conversation so interesting simply because I found Mrs Kim to be such a nice lady.  As the conversation went on and I got to know her better I realized that she had had quite a tough life, yet she had managed to maintain such a sweet and gentle personality that many other women who have been through similar struggles to her would have lost by now.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach mo ta mot buoi noi chuyen thu vi voi mot nguoi la trong qua khu cua ban.

Others argue that it is a necessary and economical form of education in addition to spreading ideas, language and culture. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"One of the most interesting topics to discuss in current times is, global marketing is spreading all over the world without any limitations while some people argue that global marketing is coming into the nation at rapid speed. On the other hand, some argue that it is important to see global marketing is expanding in every nation because, this adds exchange of ideas, languages, and cultures among the nations. In this essay, we will discuss both sides of the question and I will give my opinion. \n\nOne group of people strongly argue that global marketing is a major threat to the nation because, if everyone is interested in buying products from big companies, the local business will go into a huge loss. Perhaps, this will affect the nation's economy. Moreover, global marketing is coming into small towns where there is no place to earn profits. However, this is not recommended. Lastly, the government is also trying to spread global marketing into every corner of the nation without asking public opinion. Despite, this will cause a major impact on the local business. \n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that spreading global marketing will help the nation to improve its economy and give strong competition to other countries. In the same way, international marketing will help the nation to expose various languages, cultures, and technology. In the same way, it will give a lot of employment to the graduates. As a result, we can see a strong economic nation in a short time. \n\nIn conclusion, I suggest that international marketing is important to spread in the nation, but with some limitations, where the local businesses should not be affected.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong cua ban da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerous and should be banned.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed that dangerous activities such as skiing and diving are threatening and should be brought to a stop. In this essay I shall share my thoughts and opinions regarding the topic.\n\nFirstly, let's discuss as to why these sports are considered to be risky. One of the reasons that comes first to mind is that taking part in such activities which are highly dependent on related equipment which are not necessarily always reliable. Faults in devices used for such sports could even lead on to be fatal. Though backup equipment might be present for the user to make use of in case of an emergency, it needn't be one hundred per cent reliable cause it depends on how quick the user is to react to emergency situations. He or she should be able to demonstrate good presence of mind and agility. Another reason could be that all of these are individual sports, meaning you have no companions nor any sort of lifeguard to save you in a trouble situation. \n\nWith all that being said it is also important to consider the desires and interests of the people. There are plethora of people who love carrying out such activities. These are the type of people who are constantly in search of adventure and thrill in their lives. They are bored of their daily routine qnd want to experience some twists and turns in life even if it means involving a lot of danger.\n\nI am of the opinion that it is not right to be banning such activities because it is the choice of the individuals as to what they want to do. If they prefer playing such sports involving such high risks then let it be so. Everyone in this world has the right to choose to perform these sports and if it is his or her choice, then it must be respected. \n\nTo conclude with I would like to mention one of my thoughts. Danger can be in the form of anything and everything one does. Even if someone is cycling, running or maybe even just walking then that person could still be in some or the other sort of danger. So, it is not possible to prevent all sorts of dangers instead one should try and enjoy every part of his or her life as long as he or she can. It would most apt to end this essay with an example. A few months back I was at the football stadium viewing an intense match between Argentina and Iran. The match was going on all fine just when one of the players shot the ball really hard which ended up hitting a kid in the stands. I thought to myself,  could viewing a football match turn out to be dangerous as well? I had realised that I had found the answer to my question in the question itself that is anything and everything involves a risk factor,  so all finally depends on your fate. Your fate is what depends whether something turns out to be dangerous to you or not.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dat cau hoi truc tiep \"Should they be banned?\" va da tra loi duoc yeu cau de bai bang cach trinh bay ca hai mat tich cuc va tieu cuc cua van de do.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"We are becoming increasingly dependent on computer-based technology. How do you think it will change in the future? Is it good for us to rely so much on computers?\"\nEssay:\n\"The increasing dependence on computer-based technology has been a controversial topic currently. How this phenomenon will change and whether the reliance on it is beneficial have been a matter of concern. From my perspective, people will become more dependent on technology and this is totally good for their lives. This essay will discuss the future prospects of technology and propose its advantages.  \n\nTo begin with, in the future, technology can revolutionize people’s social and professional lives. It is a fact that nowadays machinery plays an important role in every aspect of life and makes it more convenient than in previous years. Therefore, the development of technology will change the way individuals communicate that they can make communication at distance easily via smartphones or social network platforms such as Facebook or Instagram. It also can reduce the housework burden for most women that it can do the laundry and washing up. In the future, meals can be cooked by choosing in the screen of fridge or stove which is much more convenient than in the past. Another revolution can be seen in works and school that most of work and study can be done from home through the internet and people can achieve professional aims with a lower expense.\n\nIt is often argued that excess reliance on computers can lead to negative consequences. While there is some truth to this claim, people also need to consider that computer-based technology has many advantages in their lives. Firstly, machinery can save time for individuals and offer them opportunities to have a healthy lifestyle. Thanks to some household appliances such as washing machines or dishwashers, people can leave the housework for them and spend that time engaging in physical activities. People also can save time for transportation by communicating and working from home. Secondly, technology can help to improve people’s living standards. While people had to communicate directly or by letters in the past, they can have a conversation through the internet nowadays which is much more convenient. Especially during the pandemic, people still can keep in touch with one another thanks to technology. Besides, they also can entertain themselves with electronic appliances such as television or video games which are great innovations in the revolution of technology.\n\nIn conclusion, computer-based machinery is of great importance in people’s lives that individuals will increasingly rely on it in the future. This is totally a beneficial phenomenon because of technology’s various advantages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi day du cac cau hoi trong de bai va ta ro rang nhung khia canh lien quan den su phu thuoc vao may tinh va tac dong cua no trong tuong lai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that we do not need printed newspaper anymore. To what extent do you agree or disagree ?\"\nEssay:\n\"The advent of technology has led to an upsurge in digital media, which has given rise to the belief that traditional printed newspapers have become dispensable. While some individuals may still prefer the traditional means of acquiring news, I am of the opinion that the role of online news is more significant since it provides instant information and benefits the environment. \n\nDue to the speed with which they could be updated, I believe that e-news would be superior to conventional ones. Internet users can access the most recent news within minutes as a result of real-time updates on local and international occurrences. For example, today's people can access global updates instantly on the internet or other social media, namely Facebook or Tiktok to keep themselves abreast of the latest news. In contrast, regarding the time-consuming nature of newspaper editing and publication, readers will have to wait several days before they can obtain the news relevant to some staggering events.\n\n I suppose that, in addition to the high-speed update of information, online news sources will eventually replace traditional newspapers because of their environmental benefits. In terms of the environment, the production of newspapers, which requires a large amount of paper, ink, and delivery truck distribution, the widespread adoption of e-news would save numerous trees from being cut down and reduce air pollution. On the other hand, with the increasing number of people in modern society advocating eco-friendly lifestyles, the future of conventional printed newspapers does not seem to have much potential when compared with the convenient presence of online news.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that paper-based articles are becoming obsolete and unnecessary due to the increasing popularity of e-news available on different social media platforms. This is a beneficial source for today's users to obtain instant information since it can provide immediate details of the latest events and help preserve natural resources.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai voi y kien rang ban dong y voi quan diem dung bao giay khong con can thiet nua vi su phat trien cua phuong tien truyen thong ky thuat so.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that hobbies need to be difficult to be enjoyable. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed that hobbies have to be challenging and advanced in order to be pleasing. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this view as I think hobbies are personal references and it varies depending on each individual’s aspire.\nEveryone has different personality and life; hence their hobbies can be very unique and it is not necessary to require extreme difficulty. In fact, there are a multitude of relaxing hobbies that vast majority of us commonly enjoy such as listening to music, reading books, painting…. Hobbies is subjective and its key aim is to let people discover unseen aspect and nurture themselves in their own preferred ways. We should not set standards, judge or compels anyone to live up to others ideal hobbies as it is starkly a personal choice.\nAnother point to consider is that too much of a good thing could possibly be detrimental. Hobbies that have high level of difficulty is likely to be beneficial because it boosts your competitive spirit and gives you incentive to be an expert at it. In some case it may become your profession in the future. Nonetheless, continuously pushing and pressure yourself to only enjoy hobbies that are excessively hard could result in stress and anxiety. Furthermore, you would not be able to diversify and explore yourself if you solely seeking for a certain type of hobby.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people prefer to live in a house, while others feel that there are more advantages to living in an apartment. Are there more advantages than disadvantages of living in a house compared with living in an apartment?\"\nEssay:\n\"In current world, people tend to give a lot of thoughts on choosing their preferred home. While some people prefers to live in a house, others find flats more accommodating. I am of the opinion that living in a house is more advantageous in relation to staying in an apartment. I will discuss negatives and positives of living in a house in relevance to that in an apartment in this essay. \n\nFirstly, owning and maintaining a house is relatively expensive, and usually less affordable if anyone wants to have it closer to the city, whereas flats are comparatively cheaper. For example, purchasing a land near the city is often expensive, and in addition to this there is a huge building cost while the purchasing and building cost divides among a number of tenants. Besides this, there is greater risk of security lies in houses. This is because in apartments motilities of outsiders is constantly monitored, and residents mostly have greater control on whom to let in, and on the other hand anyone can easily forcibly enter into in a house.\n\nHowever, houses offer more openness, freedom and fresh air as these usually have a front lawn where residents can enjoy warm mornings and evenings. In contrast, apartments are usually closed or have small balconies, and thus people tend to feel secluded in them. Moreover, houses are usually more customizable as they are often build on the request of the owner, and also can be easily rebuilt. This provides residents more maneuverability to design and rebuild their house as they want.\n\nIn conclusion, although apartments are often cheaper and more secured as compared to houses, I feel living in a house is more beneficial as they offer more openness, freedom and comfortable mornings and evenings, and are easier to redesign and rebuild.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da thao luan ve nhung loi ich va bat loi cua viec song trong mot ngoi nha so voi viec song trong mot can ho.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry. Why is this the case? What can be done about this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, in agricultural sector, they have made a great advancement but many people around the world still go hungry. This essay will shed some light on the causes and what solutions can be developed to remove this problem.\n\nFirst of all, the government is not paying attention to agricultural sector. They ponder that it is not important for them. In spite of having many technologies which can make more harvest, the regime is not using it. May be, they are making low budget on agricultural department. That's why it takes more time to grow rice or any other food. Moreover, the farmers are not getting enough price for their hard-work. And because of that they are unable to use the technology of agriculture. So, the price of food getting higher. One good illustration is that Bangladesh is a country where poor people go hungry. Because in Bangladesh, the price of food is very high and they don't have sufficient money to buy food.\n\nTo solve this problem, the administration should give more effort for the development of agricultural sector. They should increase the number of technology which can make good crops in short time. At the same time, the government should give enough money to the farmers so that they can produce more crops. the price of food should be low so that every people can buy food for their living. Then there will be no people who will go hungry for a single day.\n\nTo sum up, it is essential to give more importance on agriculture because without food no individual can live in this world. It will be impossible for mankind to prevent extinction without food.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co bao quat mot so nguyen nhan chinh dan den van de doi do tren the gioi, bao gom su thieu quan tam cua chinh phu doi voi nganh nong nghiep va gia thuc pham cao.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say History is one of the most important school subjects. Other people think that, in today’s world, subjects like Science and Technology are more important than History. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Technology is flourishing by leaps and bounds and provide us avenues whilst making our lives easy and comfortable. Therefore, many people tend to believe that academic subject Science and Technology must be given too-notch position rather than history because the past doesn't hold any implication in today life. I partially agree with this notion and acknowledge that both subjects are equally critical. In this essay, I will throw some light on the significance of both subjects. \n\nTo embark on, on the one side of the coin, technology is ubiquitous in all walks of life. For example, multiple appliances we use in our day to day life such as the washing machine to wash clothes, the bulb for light, the electricity for operating them all are inventions of science. Even during the pandemic, scientist do research to develop an antidote which saves the lives of the huge diaspora of population. Moreover, this trend will keep on thriving in the long run, so career prospects in this field are much brighter than other. So, people insist on giving more focus on this subject than any other.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the knowledge of our roots, culture and past is equally important for the betterment of mankind. The learnings from past events or wars prevent us from repeating the mistakes that our ancestors have committed. For example, the genocide led to the mass destruction of the population during World war 2 educates us that everybody's life is important and we should respect each other irrespective of caste, creed, sex and religion. These are the true values and learnings of the life which are required to maintain harmony and peace.\n\nTo conclude, I recapitulate that all the academic subjects have their greatness as science makes our life easy and history for required to generate a sense of compassion. So, it should be left up to the student which subject he wants to opt as per his area of interest.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach neu len quan diem cua ca hai phe, nhung van con mot so diem co the cai thien.\n\nBan co the bo sung them thong tin de lam ro hon cho quan diem cua minh.

In my opinion, I strongly agree with the first one which provides the children to select their interesting topics, which also help them to achieve their goal. \n\nFirst of all, students should have the freedom to study their interesting subjects, which can be easier for them to learn  and complete their courses. Moreover, each individual is unique, just like their ambitious and goals. Considering the fact that if they are not following this, they may be unable to fulfill their dreams which also lead them to drop their studies in between. This may create a dilemma, within the them as they might feel that they are worthless.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Overpopulation in many major urban centers around the world is a major problem. What are the causes of this? How can this problem be solved?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern world, there is a rising concern about crowded and overfilled large cities. It is essential to address this issue, otherwise, it may lead to negative consequences such as the deficit of provision and accommodation. This essay will outline the reasons for this problem and propose possible solutions. \n\nPerhaps overpopulation in megalopolises is caused by numerous opportunities there and poverty. It is not a secret that it is more likely to get a well-paid job in a big city where large corporations are located, and there is a bigger offer of leisure time activities such as museums, cinemas, parks and shopping malls. For this reason, many people prefer to move to major cities promoting overpopulation. What's more, some of these people are not so wealthy in order to control the birth rate. Consequently,  significant growth in population can occur in  poor areas.  \n\nHowever, this problem can be solved by receiving support from the authorities. Firstly, the government should introduce  restrictions on the maximum number of children per family. It would establish a balance between the increase and decline in the number of people and hold this number at a constant level. Furthermore, the governing bodies could suggest  assistance in providing free contraception. This action might prevent unwanted birth among people being not able to afford it.  \n\nTo sum up, the excessive population in large urban centres is a serious problem caused by city attractions and shortage of contraceptives among people. I recommend that governments solve this issue by proposing special birth policies and contribute to cheap and safe ways of birth prevention.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dua ra cac nguyen nhan gay ra tinh trang qua tai dan so o cac thanh pho lon tren the gioi, do la su xuat hien cua nhieu co hoi va ngheo doi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Is freedom of speech necessary in a free society? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, people prefer a society where they can express themselves openly, which helps to build a better nation in many ways. In this essay, we will look at the reasons which support the statement. \n\nFirstly, it is always necessary to maintain fairness for everyone in the country. Most of the time we listen to the government on the way they are improving the country. At times, the ideas given by elected personnel will not blend well with the public. This is where society needs to have an avenue on providing their thoughts. In addition, this will help to build equality, where everyone contributes to the betterment of a nation. For instance, in my state, a major government initiative often gets pointed out by netizens on social media, which at times is seen to be logical and will be good if the ideas are implemented. \n\nSecondly, the public will have the freedom to point on the wrongdoings of individuals including officials without fear of being criminalized. This further helps to create a better society to live in where people will blend in well with authorities such as the police. In addition, government officials will tend to perform their duties better as they can be called out by the public for their mistakes. For instance, in my country, the police department gets frequent feedback from the public on the way they treat criminals, which helps them to implement better policies. Nevertheless, individuals who openly speaks on current issues can be identified as future leaders of the nation, where they will have an understanding of society and strategies towards the betterment of it. \n\nIn conclusion, a nation should allow its citizens to speak freely on issues related to the country and accept the criticism so that it will provide benefits that will help to build a better community. This allows the people of the nation to live peacefully where equal treatment is given for all.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va cung cap day du thong tin ve vai tro cua tu do ngon luan trong xay dung mot xa hoi tu do.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"People in many countries are spending less time with their family. What are the reasons, and effects of this?\"\nEssay:\n\"These days it is becoming common for each person to spend much less time with their household, compared with the past. This is happening due to some reasons ranging from addiction to technology to overworking. This essay will focus on the situation and provide the consequences caused by this.\nFirst of all, the main cause of this, in my perspective, is overworking. Because the majority of people work more hours at their workplace, they have a very little amount of time to be together with their family members. The second reason of this is the fact that most people nowadays are addicted to social media. They are spending much of their time sitting in front of notebook or chatting online, which wastes their precious time.\nRegarding the effects, the situation is resulting in lack of time of people to hang out with their relatives, which is especially essential for children. This could lead youngsters to feel separateness from family, and might influence badly on their upbringing. The second cause is that they might be less social as a result of getting obsessed with work. If they are overworked constantly, they might become isolated from people.\nIn conclusion, the main reason of being less with family is working too much and social media.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Music is played in every society and culture in the world today. Some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Music has played a pivotal role throughout our history. However, there are mixed opinions about its significance, as many believe it to be a boon for humankind, while others consider it as a curse. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and give my personal opinion on the subject matter. Firstly, I will explain how music has helped in transformation of our society and secondly, I will write down the negative influences of the same. \n\nAs the saying goes, \"Music is universal, as it transcends all the cultural and linguistic barriers\". Hence, music has played a significant role in the unification of the world. Historically, it has influenced and ignited major revolutions and had been a catalyst for almost every social reforms. For example, during the Indian independence movement, the songs penned down by revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh and Ram Prasad Bismil, had a long-lasting impact on the youth irrespective of their cultural belonging, eventually contributing to fire-up the overall cause and saving the nation from the hands of tyranny. In addition to that, music is an essential part of medical science. It is used as a relaxation medium in therapy and, also during the treatment of multiple psychological illness such as Alzheimers, anxiety, panic attacks etc. \n\nOn the other hand, there are many negative impacts of music largely due to the success and fame it brings to the artists. Musical talents enjoy immense popularity and lead a luxurious lifestyle, often engaging in anti-social activities such as drug use and alchoholism. As a result of this, the large followers gained by these artists, also dream of a similar way of living like their ideals, resulting in a counter-culture attitude among the youth. This can be easily seen from the activities that took place in the 1960s in USA as a response to the Vietnam war and Civil rights movement. Musicians largely engaged in drugs and alchohol, inspired a generation of youth to lead a care-free lifestyle, eventually resulting in vandalism and damage to public properties. \n\nIn conclusion, there may be many negative influences of music and it's use. However, in my opinion, the positives outweigh the negatives and music should be promoted worldwide.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach bao quat ca hai quan diem va bay to quan diem cua minh.

For example, environmental engineers are required to develop the new models for minimizing waste. The course at their universities is theoretically based. And when they start their jobs, they enable to use the knowledge in the execution of the model. The solution is that the educational institutions should upgrade their course according to market demand.\nAnother trouble is that the doctors and teachers are highly paid in the developed countries. It can be said that job opportunities in the countries like Pakistan are fewer. Contrarily, there are many ways of growth in the countries like US and Australia. To tackle such issue, the Board of Directors must come to the front line and take steps to revise the salaries of the specialists in order to reduce relocation from their countries.\nA third cause of the problem is the work hours. The jobs in the poor countries are nine to five per day. This would end up in minimum socializing, and it is hard for the people to find time even for themselves. In contrast, job timing is specified by the Administration, in Europe. They are allowed to carry out their profession in 6 to 7 hours a day. The issue is only resolved if Management allocates special timings for all types of labour.\nTo sum up, migration of the skilled workers will lead to skill shortage and poorer economic growth due to lack of product placements after graduation. That is a serious dilemma, and unless Government launches new schemes for employments with a handsome pay.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cau hoi de bai va diem nguyen nhan gay ra van de cung nhu dua ra cac giai phap de giai quyet.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people support the idea of imposing taxes on fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) in order to reduce energy consumption. Others disagree with this approach. Consider the debate and its arguments, and come to your own conclusion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Most people agree that the use of fossil fuels should be reduced to some extent. However, imposing taxes is a controversial tactic which appears to have a number of contradictory effects. We will consider bothsides of the discussion in this essay.\nOn the one hand, those who support taxation of fossil fuels promote the idea that higher prices will lead to lower consumption and thus lower emissions. They point to evidence from countries such as Sweden where this appears to be the case, and urge other nations to follow suit. Furthermore, proponents of fuel taxes claim that the funds raised can then be used to subsidise renewable energy projects such as solar and localised biofuel reactors. To the supporters of the idea, these benefits are convincing.\nHowever, opponents of fuel tax are able to cite evidence from other countries (including France and Italy) where higher tax has apparently not reduced demand for such fuels. In these cases, the effect has been to force people to pay more for the same volume of energy, which appears to penalise those who can least afford it. Moreover, critics of fuel tax also highlight the difficulty in governments promising renewable schemes without interfering in the entire energy market. If the state was to control the entire market for fuels, they say, this would force suppliers to leave the market, thus reducing competition and efficiency. This argument also appears to be quite powerful.\nOverall, I would tend to side with the opponents of fuel taxation. It seems to be unreasonable to force vulnerable consumers to pay more for a commodity which is essential to them, without a real infrastructure for renewable energy being in place. It would be more logical to improve availability of renewables first, which would allow consumers to make a genuine choice.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach trinh bay y kien cua nguoi ung ho viec danh thue nhien lieu hoa thach va nguoi phan doi viec nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Today, most people get married and give birth in their thirties rather than when they are younger.Is it a positive or negative development in your opinion? To what extent do you support this development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the majority of individuals marry and have babies in their thirties than at a younger age. This is a positive development as it allows the couples to develop a strong career and be financially stable. However, because of the concerns of an increasing number of infertility issues, I completely disagree with this development. \nFirstly, late marriage is beneficial to the individuals in many ways. One of the prominent benefits of the same is the ability to develop their career paths. Before marriage, people are generally free to explore different careers and because of having plenty of time, they can decide better about the career that they can pursue during the rest of their life. Secondly, late marriage allows an individual to be financially stable and abide by the responsibilities conferred by marriage more carefully. Marriage brings in new responsibilities and requires money for the fulfilment of those responsibilities. For instance, in a recent study by 'The Times\",  it has now been proven that people, who are married after their thirties,  are better able to fulfil their responsibilities both financially and mentally. Thus we can say that late marriages are better than earlier ones.\nOn the other hand,  late marriages are proven harmful to the women. With the passage of time, the reproductive power of the women decreases. In a research by WHO, for instance, it has now been proven that the chances of a woman getting pregnant almost halves after attaining the age of thirty. Then what is the benefit of getting married if they cannot have children?  This becomes a cause for disturbance in the family and sometimes leads to serious consequences of divorce.\nIn conclusion, white, late marriages offer benefits of career and financial stability, due to the issue of infertility, I disagree with this development.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai va tap trung vao viec thao luan tich cuc hay tieu cuc cua viec ket hon va sinh con o do tuoi 30.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"government should spend more on railways than on roads\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"To overcome the problems related to railways, it is suggested that the Government should allocate more budget for developing better rail tracks compared to roads and I completely agree with this idea for two main reasons.\n\nI believe that investing more in  the railways would be  beneficial in several ways. Firstly, travelling by train is much safer, less time consuming, cheaper and overall environment friendly. For example, my country India, having huge a population of poor and middle class people , and massive traffic congestion problems, highly rely on its  railway transport system to facilitate its dwellers. Every day, millions of daily commuters use this expended mode  for commuting. On the other hand , if the same proportion of people had travelled through roads , governments would  need approximately  five times wider roads.\n\nSecondly, in developing countries like India , where railways are entirely government undertaking, spending higher in this sector will not only generate more revenue, but also helps the state to facility very large number of people. Lastly, the cost of developing railway tracks is quite high, and this is even higher for making special tracks for bullet trains. These tracks help in making rail travelling safer, faster and reliable.However, overlooking them   could be a big hindrance in developing an efficient railway transport system.  \n\nTo conclude, I believe that investing higher does not mean that governments are going to neglect the progress of roads.  Keeping in view the aforesaid  benefits  , I believe that government should assign the higher amount of  funds for developing rails compared roads\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da rat tot ve phan Task Response, boi ban da tra loi day du cau hoi dua ra trong de bai va khong co bat ky thong tin nao bi dao lon hoac nham lan.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed. that computers are The most significant invention of the centennial. I disagree to a great extent because there are many other innovations which have changed the way of living a lot but I also believe that it is a well-needed development as well. Both situations will be explained in the upcoming paragraphs\n\nTo start with, technology has changed the of living a lot in the last hundred years and surprised us with new inventions. Mobile phones are a necessity in today's world because people use them For various purposes. Mobile phones are not only used to communicate with friends and relatives but also used for entertainment and day-to-day activities. for example, traveling becomes so much easier than past because of google maps. Moreover, Drones have taken the place of Cameras which is also a big invention in the field of technology. They have reduces the struggle and work of cameramen and enhances the quality of pictures and videos recorded. Another worth considering innovation of the last century is in the field of motor vehicles. Electric vehicles are replacing fuel-used cars and motorbikes which result in a more sustainable environment and advancement in individual's life.\n\nOn the other hand, computers are also a significant invention and they are still in use in their updated form like laptops and monitors. They have their importance which is irreplaceable by other electronics. For instance, people cannot use mobile phones in their offices in place of computers. Hence, computers are one of the major advancements of the last hundred years.\n\nTo conclude, I believe computers play an important role in today's era and are considered a necessary innovation but we cannot ignore other major technological advancements in other industries.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co phan anh dung mot phan cau hoi de bai, tuy nhien, chua tra loi het mot cach ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Most employees do job interviews before offering position to a person. Do you think this is the best way to do it or are there better alternatives? What is the best method of choosing employer in your opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"Today, many people have to go through interviews in order to get selected for a position. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this method of appointing employees, as this gives the leverage to employers to choose the best candidates and also, job seekers get to know better about his/her employer during the whole interview process.\n\nTo commence with, many organisations today have a thorough selection process in order to find the best out of all that suits their requirements. The job interview is one of the steps that is included in this process and it plays an important role to examine the candidate's efficiency. To cite an example, for many software engineers, Google is one of their dream companies, and to get selected, some might have to take 6 to 8 rounds for a senior role. This method has proven successful in finding the best gems and that is the reason, Google is one of the most advanced and highly used search engines.\n\nFurthermore, getting selected via interviews is a transparent method of getting a job. There were days when people used to get opportunities based on their contacts and references. In addition, job seekers can choose their employers effectively beforehand as they have plenty of resources where they can check about the experiences of past employees and verify organisation ratings. Moreover, during the whole interview process, they will get in contact with senior colleagues which will enable the employees to get to know their employer better.\n\nTo sum up, I firmly believe that many companies follow the right process of hiring employees through job interviews. I believe that the aforementioned points are strongly supporting my viewpoints.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi trong de bai va ly giai quan diem cua ban ro rang va thuyet phuc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"People have historically attempted to achieve a perfect society. However, it is difficult to decide what a perfect society would be like. What would be the most important element of an ideal society? What can normal people do to make society more perfect?\"\nEssay:\n\"Having a perfect society is mankind’s dream, unfortunately, this is hard to achieve as many different factors should work in an optimal proportion. I personally think that peace is the most essential factor of an ideal world, for these citizens need to follow rules and regulations of society and should develop higher level of tolerance.\n\nFirstly, peacefulness which is extremely essential tool to lead a perfect life. This is because citizens would enjoy their lives its fullest and do not need to fear about getting attacked by others. In other words, crime rates seem to be at a minimum in such areas, for instance, theft, murders, money laundering and so on. Similarly, equality which is not only between different genders, income groups but religions also should be there.\n\nHowever, maintaining peace in society is not an easy task since it is multifactorial. Firstly, despite social and economical differences members of the community need to accept the system of their country. By following this, there is a less chance to witness any break in the peacefulness of the area. Additionally, rarely do we see criminals, manipulators grow there. Instead, if people argued against the law of the land, the people would experience social unrest and conflicts. To illustrate this, when observing the world happiness index, it shows that countries, where their citizens remain within the constitution, are happier and the places are considered peaceful.\n\nIn conclusion, although building a perfect nation or society is seemed to be a utopia, I think if everyone starts following their county’s law and order would bring peace. This is the most significant factor to achieve a perfect society.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung day du yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The threat of nuclear weapons maintains world peace. Nuclear power provides cheap and clean energy.\nThe benefits of nuclear technology far outweigh the disadvantages.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It has been believed that the fear of the atomic bomb ensures peace around the globe. Nuclear energy has many advantages such as the provision of cheap and Eco-friendly electricity, and this outweighs the disadvantages. I fully agree with this statement.\n\nNuclear technology presents a vital role to give public protection to all citizens of the world. Moreover, many strong and powerful countries such as the USA, Russia, China, India have made nuclear weapons and utilize this whenever harmful situation happens between countries to save the citizens. For instance, In 1965, China-India war India has utilized a nuclear atom against china to save its people. Furthermore, these nuclear atomic bombs can destroy living creatures such as buildings in a fraction of seconds. To illustrate, In 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb over the city of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and killed many people during the attack.\n\nNuclear power plays a beneficial role in human life and it also is used for producing various energies. It helps to generate cheap and clean energy. Nuclear power plants generate electricity from smaller atoms and releasing energy. For instance, In large cities, Nuclear power plant provides sufficient energy to give electricity. Although, some countries have made water refinement energy plants to provide clean water to its citizens and it helps for living to survive. For example, Russia has made a water refinement energy plant in 1965 for its residents with low-cost money.\n\nTo conclude, this essay disagrees with the opinion of nuclear energy is beneficial rather than dangerous because using nuclear energy in the wrong way would be affected both our species and the earth itself.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi duoc cau hoi de bai bang cach trinh bay cac loi ich va nhuoc diem cua nang luong hat nhan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Companies should provide sports and social facilities for local communities. To what extent do you agree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays recreation, leisure and sports activities play an important role in any societies. Therefore private and public organizations should contribute in promoting sports and social activities by providing infrastructure or by conducting games and public events. In my opinion providing facilities to local societies can have many beneficial effects, so I agree with this point of view.\n On the one hand, sports have a great value for any countries. It is an enjoyable and effective way to improve physical and mental health. In addition, it can relieve stress, increas fitness and prevent the development of chronic disease,   such as heart disaese. Thus, arrangement of sports projects will boost the healthy environment in the society and also become  tthe source of motivation. Furthermore, sports activities not only reduce crime, but also decrease alcohol and drug misuse and anti-social behaviours.\nOn the other hand, citizens of any countries or any local comunities have their own ancient traditions and forefather culture. Companies should try to help people maintain and remember their traditional values. For example, they can host entertainment programs like cultural dance and art play. It can encourage people to participate in the social activities and enhance their skills. Furthermore, it will maintain the culture between the generations.\nIn conclusion, the game events and social gathering are very important to community wich create a positive and healthy environment and lead to peaceful.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that the change is always a good thing. Discuss both the views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant example from your knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"People are different from each other in many ways. One such difference is the way of spending life. While some people like to spend their life doing one job or similar routine, others prefer changes in their lives. In my opinion a continuous change in life is the way to live. In the following essay we will discuss both views.\nA famous saying is “never drink from stagnant river”. Firstly, some people get bored of same routine. They need change that can either be in job or daily routine. This helps them to take their mind off certain things and explore better options for themselves. For example it is a common trend among Irish people to seek for jobs overseas. This helps them in learning the life better and find better opportunities for themselves. Secondly, some people resort to travelling and living abroad for extended periods of time. Their idea is to take a time off from the same routine and spend some time in foreign culture and understanding different ways of life. For instance many government servants take time off after retirement to travel and enjoy their lives.\nOn the other hand, some people prefer to follow a strict routine. This is their way of life which has discipline. Such people are generally more career focused and cannot take the risk of discontinuity. For example, If we glance at lives of Buddha monks, their way of life is everything to them. Following strict routines help them to be strong. Similarly many sportsperson follow same routine of working certain hours of the day and focusing on health in the rest of time. Hence the choice depends on individuals thinking.\nIn conclusion, both views have their own advantages and disadvantages, but most of it depends on personal choices and preferences. In my opinion traveling and continuous change is the way to live in the world as it gives us more chance to explore the world and find better option for our careers.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nYeu cau de bai co duoc tra loi khong?\n- Co, bai viet da tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem va dua ra quan diem ca nhan.\n\nBai viet co giai thich day du tat ca cac phan cua nhiem vu khong?\n- Mac du bai viet da thao luan ve ca hai quan diem va dua ra lap luan, tuy nhien, loi gioi thieu cua bai viet chua du mach lac va chi tiet de cung cap cho doc gia mot cai nhin tong quan ve van de.\n\nY tuong co duoc mo rong day du khong?\n- Y tuong trong bai viet da duoc mo rong day du thong qua viec su dung vi du va lap luan de ho tro quan diem cua minh.\n\nLoi can sua:\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays most green energy is becoming ever more prevalent in both developed and developing countries. Some argue they greatly reduce costs and are better for the environment, others believe they are a serious threat to energy security. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Protecting nature is vital to environmental balance. Nowadays, nations committed to sustainability are using more renewable energy than ever before since it contributes to the preservation of the environment and also may be economically viable. However, some leaders argue that green energy could undermine (implicate) the reliability of the global energy supply as a result of its dependency on climate. This essay will discuss both views, but personally, I believe that renewable sources of energy are the future.\n\nOn the one hand, there is a concern in most developed and developing countries that green energy has supply chain risks. This is the fact that it may largely depend on unreliable conditions such as wind, wave and rain, which are clean source are of power energy and largely depend on weather conditions. This concern has increased due to world climate changes and can be a serious threat to energy security if the nation depends only on this type of energy.\n\nOn the other hand, fossil fuels are a larger threat to energy security since they are certainly finite in quantity, whereas renewable energy is effectively infinite. One day the earth’s oil can full out, there will be no energy security without green energy technologies. Furthermore, problems of unpredictability can be mitigated by improving battery technologies, building more renewable energy generators (to increase supply during ideal conditions) and improving current technologies (to increase efficiency), such as in the moving solar panel example. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the green energy is likely to risk dependent on weather conditions, I believe that it can be installed with a minimum amount and there are no threats to our environment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nYeu cau de bai co duoc tra loi khong? \n- Co, ban da tra loi ca hai quan diem ve nang luong xanh (y cho va phan doi).\n- Ban da cung cap luan diem cua rieng minh va cho thay su ung ho cua ban doi voi nang luong tai tao.\n\nBai viet co giai thich day du tat ca cac phan cua nhiem vu khong? \n- Bai viet cua ban da giai thich day du cac quan diem khac nhau ve nang luong xanh va giu duoc su can doi giua hai quan diem.\n- Ban da de cap den rui ro ve su phu thuoc vao dieu kien thoi tiet cua nang luong xanh va de xuat cac giai phap de giam thieu van de nay.\n\nY tuong co duoc mo rong day du khong? \n- Ban da mo rong y tuong cua minh thong qua vi du va lap luan cu the.\n- Ban da thao luan ve nguy co lien quan den nang luong tai tao va da chi ra rang van de nay co the duoc giam thieu bang cach cai thien cong nghe luu tru nang luong va phat trien cong nghe hien tai.\n\nLoi can sua:\n- Khong co loi cu the trong Task Response.\n\nVi du cho loi cai thien:\n- Khong co vi du cu the cho loi can cai thien vi khong co loi dang ke trong Task Response.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Traffic and housing problems in major cities could be solved by moving large companies and factories and their employees to the countryside.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is common belief that there are those who protest relocation of big-size companies, factories as well as their staffs to rural areas. Yet, I firmly believe that this initiative is considered as a solution to traffic congestion and a shortage of accommodation. And this essay will address and enlist the following approaches.\nTo commence with, transferring sizable corporations and their workers out of inner-city, lead to alleviate the current traveling overload. Each large-scale businesses have hordes of workers who are able to be considered as the chief culprit behind the traffic jam problem, especially in the rush hours. As a consequence, the shift of big companies together with their employees to rural areas would help tackle the congested roads. Additionally, toxic waste from the means of transports is the key factor influencing pollution. Therefore, shifting the companies, factories, and employees to the suburb is able to cut down on emissions into the atmosphere through the acts of lowering the extent of vehicles circulating on the streets.\nOn top of that, it firms as together with factories transfer to the suburban area in order to relieve the pressure on urban housing supply systems. According to the recent survey, that workers have the propensity for opting for their accommodation near their works, giving rise to the apartment demand as well as the living cost. Consequently, if there has a tremendous shift in accommodation to the suburban area, city houses and apartments price will fall and be more reasonable with city dwellers.\nIn conclusion, by relocating workers to rural areas to work and reside, heavy traffic conditions and shortage of accommodation in city centers could be handled. From my perspective, I am certain that the aforementioned solutions will solve the problem effectively.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va co y tuong duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Is saving more important than spending in today’s world? How far do you agree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer, and provide ideas and examples from your own experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is argued that saving is more vital than spending in our nowadays world. According to many opinions, in different aspects, expenditure brings people more benefits than saving does. In my point of view, I completely agree with that opinion and I will discuss 2 main reasons to prove my agreement.\n\nIn the first place, spending money can meet our subsistence needs. We can buy things that serve and improve our daily life. Such as purchasing a house to live, a motorbike or a car for traveling, or maybe a smartphone which is so necessary in our modern life. In addition, the acquisition of food, drinks and clothes everyday is also so important, especially to women, the one that takes care of people in a family. Moreover, monthly services’ bills such as water, electricity and Internet are needed to be paid.\n\nAs a result, being the second reason, spending can satisfy people's metal and material needs. As a consequence, that can bring us more content. We can buy whatever we want whenever we need. That is nothing but a sense of freedom and happiness. For example, when you go shopping or traveling, you can not deny that the sense of feeling afraid to see price when you buy things or souvenirs is so annoying. Furthermore, when you make a purchase of  a shirt, a toy that you like, a movie or music concert ticket,etc, you are happy. Being able to afford all daily needs somehow can make you proud of yourself and bring you a sense of confidence in life. And then your parents, your friends will be proud of you too. It all combined together creates a positive energy, a motivation for us to work harder and make more money to meet that feeling again.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that spending money will improve our material and mental life.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong cua ban da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe children should get homework everyday, while others think they should not. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Education is a very much needed exigency part of our life. If children or youngsters do not get a good education, it will be devastating for their lives. Whether or not children should receive homework every day is a matter of debate. Some people believe that children should get homework every day from school and on the other hand, some people believe that children should not get too much homework from school. \nBoth views will be discussed in this essay before concluding.\n\nFirstly, we must understand the concept of homework. The teacher is not able to cover a full course in school so that they give an assignment to children. Furthermore, most of the students are not doing their homework unless it is necessary, so it is important to give them homework. Moreover, some subjects need practice. For example, science, mathematics, and art need constant practice, if they do not, it is very difficult to understand for them. By giving homework it automatically helps to improve. Practice makes perfect.\n\nHowever, it is important to give homework to youngsters but children spend 7-8 hours in school, after school if a teacher gives to much homework, it pressurizes many children. Besides this, when the children get too much homework, they are not able to do any other physical activity which is also important in their lives. And it is also caused to depreciation.\nIn my opinion, the concept of homework is not harmful. The problem arises when a teacher gives too much homework and when a student fails to use their time wisely. For example, if the deadline for a specific assignment is after 2 weeks, most students would leave it until the very last minute and by doing this they are putting themselves under unwanted pressure.\nIn conclusion, I think children should get homework for their improvement.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi trong de bai vi no trinh bay ca hai quan diem ve viec cho tre em lam bai tap ve nha va dua ra quan diem ca nhan cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think governments are responsible for peoples health, others believe its an indiviuduals responsibility. \nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Healthcare remains a very crucial part of out basic amenities. The topic of whether or not people or the government should be held accountable for issues partaining to health,  remains very controversial. In my opinion, the government should be solely in charge of the health of its citizens at all times. \n\nOn one hand, health care as well as the funding for the research into cures and vaccines are expensive. Private firms and singular entities cannot bear the burden alone. Furthermore, the cost of hospital admissions, investigations and medications would cripple the finances of the individual without governemt aid and policies. All fingers are not equal, therefore, the government plays a huge role by providing subsidized care to patients in its publicly funded facilities. For example, data from a survey carried out by the World Health Organization , in Nigeria , in 2013, revealed that many Nigerians depend entirely on the government to access excellent medical care. \n\nOn the other hand, people are the masters of their bodies. Most diseases in the world today are preventable, that is, they are mostly caused by poor lifestyle choices. Individuals should incocate the habit of proper diet, exercise and regular medical checkups to keep fit and also  to detect illnesses at the early stages. \n\nIn conclusion, while some are of the opinion that governments should be responsible for health, others are of the school of thought that it rests on the individual. I believe that it is the  responsibility of governments to cater for the health of all its nationals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach de hieu va ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Famous sportsmen often earn a lot of more money than people in other professions. Although sports is important in our lives, everyone should be equal and such big incomes of sport professionals are unjustified. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Earning a huge amount of wage by eminent sports personalities, compared to other professional workers, is inappropriate because it is right of every skilled person to get capital equally despite knowing the fact that sport is insurmountable in people's lives. I am in consummate accordance with this notion as well.\n\n\nThere are a number of reasons to support my view and predominant one is more important to the work of other professions than sports personnel. There is no doubt that other proficient individuals not only serve the citizens of a nation, but also help to boost the economy of the country in the form of their work. Doctors, for example, treat diversified patients in every possible situation and pay their taxes on time which redounds government to facilitate its people. But players do enjoyment and play sports to earn wealth for themselves. In short, being true facilitators, other skilful workers provide more aid in many useful ways.\n\n\nHowever, some people opine that money earned by renowned sports persons is justifiable because they suffer from severe injuries while playing, just to bring laurels for their country. So, they deserve receiving a hefty amount of earnings in return for their efforts because if they get a serious injury during performance and are not able to pursue their career in sports, they can at least utilize that money for the rest of their life. But I believe that other adepts like soldiers, should get more wages as they safeguard their nation twenty-four seven and sometimes, in unfortunate conditions, sacrifice their lives for saving their citizens. Therefore, giving more salary to popular players than other industrious humans is unjustified. \n\n\nIn conclusion, although sports personalities encounter numerous difficulties, just for the pride of their country, I reaffirm that division of pay should be equal among persons pertaining to any profession, considering their hard work.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban xu ly de bai mot cach tuong doi tot.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The world has seen an enormous increase in flights for leisure,business and commercial purpose around the world over recent years. \nWhat do you think are the main advantages and disadvantages of such flights?\nDo you think flight should be texted more?\"\nEssay:\n\"Exploration to many countries for enjoyment, trades and exchange phenomena for a few decades in the universe is enhancing drastically. From my perspective, the aircraft schedule should be extended more to create a smooth economical flow. This essay will discuss of the merits of the boarding on aeroplane and also describe some related demerits of this issue.\n\nOne of the positives of doing business using an aeroplane is to increase the profit of trades. Not only that the development of the exchange issues at the same time, but also it creates a lot of savings of the time issues. Compare to the past men are now very busy with their tasks. To demonstrate, they have to go to various places which distance is too long. As a result, the more time that he lessens, the more making profit can be possible. Another advantage is that, it can reduce physical pressure. For instance, if a person goes abroad he can prosper his tasks and it would be possible if he uses aeroplane for his journey.\n\nDespite these advantages, aircraft is not a cheap issue. Moreover, a folk who is rich in his wealth can be able to use the aeroplane. This is because the costing of manufacturing plane is too high. Hence, the journey is too long to endure it for his body. As a consequence, a person must have physical stamina where he can travel to long-distance for his business works. For example, if a human wants to ordain his journey he has to prepare a lot of money. Therefore, there is no need to add any flight if a person cannot be able to purchase the aircraft journey schedule.\n\nTo sum up, using aircraft is required to construct a development of the country's financial condition and in my opinion, the enhancing of flight schedule may make a more prosper for the nation. However, fair for plain travel should be reasonable so that it can be purchasable for the all classes of the people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da nhan dien duoc mot so loi ich chinh cua cac chuyen bay danh cho viec tham quan, kinh doanh va thuong mai, cung nhu nhung han che lien quan den viec nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"people have difference visions about shopping online some of them encourage and others says its disadvantage outweigh their advantage, what is your opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"Trading on the Internet has become more prevalent since the pandemic. Some traditional dealers believe it can cause detrimental impacts on the existing stores on the street so online shops should be limited rigidly. However, I believe the merits of trading online override the demerits and I will elaborate on the reasons in the following essay.\n\nTo commence, shopping online saves transportation efforts for both customers and sellers. For example, customers can browse the products they need through the website whenever they want. They do not need to travel distances to the stores in person. Similarly, the dealers do not need to stand in their stores and wait for their buyers in a fixed business hour. They only move the merchandise from the stocks to delivery when the order is made. \n\nNevertheless, some traditional sellers argue that online shops have threatened the existing commercial models and raised countless trade disputes. Although the value of the products can be difficult to be estimated on the Internet, the Taiwanese government has already provided online shoppers with a complete resolution. Thus, the customers can return the products unconditionally within one week. Taking that risks into consideration, the online dealers might have risen the prices of the goods, but the price will strike the balance again in the market eventually.\n\nIn conclusion, despite some disputes in trading, online shops provide not only convenience but also  economic efficiency in transportation. As a result, I believe this shopping model should be encouraged and such a shopping habit will be widely adopted by the general public.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai: \"people have difference visions about shopping online some of them encourage and others says its disadvantage outweigh their advantage, what is your opinion?\" va da gioi thieu suy nghi cua ban ve viec mua sam truc tuyen.\n\nTuy nhien, mot so chi tiet trong bai viet cua ban co the can phai duoc ro rang hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people that passports are essential as a way of regulating the population  of countries. Others believe they should be abolished and we should be able to travel where we like. Discuss both points of view and give your own opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"In our contemporary world, several problems have brought to attention of public, and one of them is that of having passports which is leading this issue to become matter of considerable controversy. And in today's confabulation, one school of thought surmise that identification card should be necessary for all individuals. But on the other hand, others claim that certain certificates should be abrogated and population should make travels whenever they desire without passports. And this essay will display a further discussion on this topic before reaching any conclusion. \n\nTo begin with, this essay will fundamentally support a former view. Incipiently, with assistance of passports government can make a control as well as they can implement some rules which could help it. And in that way knowing such growing population could come as a dilemma and passports can make an opportunity to work effectively in this moments. Secondly, without ID cards crime rates can increase tremendously. As government can not be informed about a person who committed a crime. Furthermore in all passports there are would be enough details to identify the individuality of gangsters.\n\nOn the other hand there some people who are of the opinion like this kind of documents about identity should be abated in order to do flights much more frequently. Precisely, individuals can be free from stressful documentations before their flight. But it is on the other hand detrimental they can not be under the control of government without passports. As with government population can be shielded from political pressures which they are suffering in other countries.\n\nTo conclude it is advantageous for people in order to make flights in certain aspects. But collaterally it has its own disadvantages in terms of politics and as well as controlling crime.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, tuy nhien, ban can dua ra cac lap luan cu the hon de thuyet phuc nguoi doc va chung minh quan diem cua minh.\n\nVi du, ban co the dua ra cac lap luan ho tro cho quan diem cua minh, nhu la tai sao cac quoc gia can phai kiem soat dan so, hoac nhung hau qua khon luong neu khong co chung minh nhan than (nhu tron thue, mao danh v.v.).

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Young people these days tend to be less polite and respectful than in the past. Causes and solutions.\"\nEssay:\n\"Lifestyle has undergone dramatic changes over couple of decades. It is irrefutable that the modern generation nowadays has become less considerate and civil than in the earlier times. Here,i would like to explore the possible causes of this situation and suggest some ways forward.\n\nThere are multifarious causes behind this phenomenon.The most important cause is the disintegration of the traditional joint family system. In today‘s nuclear families, there are no grandparents to teach moral values to children. Parents are busy working and do not spend quality time with children. Consequently, children become self-centred and uncaring for the world around them.\n\nFurther emphasizing from my point of view. Nowadays,we are part of a consumerist society. We desire to have the latest things and to get those things we are becoming workaholics. We set goals for ourselves and work hard to achieve them. As a result politeness and respect have taken a back seat. Finally, we have the influence of the western culture. There, it is considered quite normal to argue and question the elders. By contrast,others have conflicting views.\n\nThey think that it is necessary to install moral values in children at a young age. So, joint family system should be encouraged. Secondly, community welfare programmes should be part of high school curriculum. We can also take the help of media to show programmes which highlight the good points of earlier times and discourage consumerism. But, the final onus is on the people themselves. They should be willing to change.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, in the fast-paced world of today, people have changed and become selfish and self centred, but steps can be taken to re-imbibe some virtues of the olden times.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va dua ra cac y chinh can thiet de giai quyet van de.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think environmental problems are too big for individuals to solve. Others, however, think that those problems can be solved unless individuals take some action. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"The issues related to the environment such as global warming, climate change and pollution are getting more and more severe, which has become too challenging for each citizen to handle. However, others believe that people need to take responsibility for protecting and preserving their surrounding environment, so the huge mentioned problems can be mitigated. In this essay, both views will be discussed before giving my perspective.  \n\nIt is justifiable why the idea that individuals cannot deal with  huge environmental problems is in favour. The first reason is that humans cannot control or change unprecedented harsh natural phenomena, namely floods, drought, tsunamis, and other weather patterns. The only thing they can do is to adapt and have preparation to minimize the damage caused by these problems. Besides, it should be the government’s responsibility to introduce laws imposing on their citizens on protecting the environment. The explanation is no one can change a situation without  collective power. In other words, people are willing to work together only if there is a proper guide and encouragement from their authorities. For example, how a normal city dweller stops an industrial factory from performing their working activities without releasing carbon dioxide into the air. Hence, what is needed is  regulation from the authorities to control the factory’s harmful activities to the environment. \n\nOn the other side, there are a variety of reasons why people advocate solving  environmental problems individually. Admittedly, it is humans’ daily activities that lead to all types of pollution. To be more specific, it has been proved that the amount of CO2 emitted from private cars and motorbikes pollutes the air and the act of throwing garbage and plastic bags into the rivers pollutes water. In the same way, the increasing use of electric household appliances, especially air conditioners, contributes to intensifying the greenhouse effect which causes global warming. Therefore, if each person can adopt a green lifestyle, for example, saying no to plastic bags, using public transportation to commute or cutting down on their use of electric appliances at home, the environmental issues can be eliminated significantly. \n\nIn conclusion, I hold the same view that environmental sustainability depends greatly on each citizen’s discipline and responsibility. However, to guarantee individuals act in protecting the Earth to work effectively, it is  governments around the world that should enact proper environment-protecting laws for their people to oblige.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi day du cau hoi trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some believe it is important for cities and towns to invest heavily in building large outdoor public spaces.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"With the development of populations in cities and towns, the living density is rising sharply in recent years. People need more outdoor space to relax and take activities, so I think it is important to invest suitably in building outdoor public areas, not heavily.\n\nBuilding large outdoor public space in the city and town could provide an area for the citizen to relax and enjoy the free time. Due to the heavy working stress in the office, people need an outdoor space to relax. In addition, most public parks or outdoor activity areas are close to the huge community. Residents could easily arrive there, and walk around or play with their children. For instance, I live in the city place area, there is a huge public area in front of my apartment. There are a dog park, soccer field, and some activity equipment. I saw a lot of people went to the park when they get off work. Some people were walking their dogs, and some people play with their children. Therefore, the outdoor public field is an important relaxing place in people’s daily life. \n\nHowever, although building outdoor public is beneficial to citizen, that does not mean the government needs to invest a lot of funding into that. A suitable amount of money is acceptable. For example, the government need to research the data of public construction expense every year for all districts in the city and town. Moreover, the authority should arrange a number of investment reasonably for building public parks and activities. After they made the decision, residents have the right to vote to agree or disagree. If do so, it will be an effective way to control the cost of public construction. Therefore, the government could support the construction of the public space, but investing a reasonable amount of money is acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, for this discussion, I agree to build more public outdoor areas in cities and towns, because people need this kind of place to relax and enjoy the leisure time. However, the government needs to control the investment. The amount of spending should be calculated in advance.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nVe phan Task Response, bai viet cua ban da dua ra y kien dung ve viec xay dung khong gian cong cong ngoai troi la quan trong cho cac thanh pho va thi tran.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Multicultural societies in which there are a mixture of ethnic people bring more benefits than drawbacks to a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Migration of people to various part of the world is becoming increasingly popular. Consequently, people end up settling in communities where they share different cultural background. Many believe there are more advantages of inhabiting in such a multicultural community than the potential setbacks that may arise. I completely agree with this view. This is because the problem that may emerge can be overcome and cultural mix leads societal development.\n\nThe fear of losing cultural heritage is one major issue that makes individuals believe that mixing with other people with different ethnicity may be a drawback for them. They think new immigrant may not respect their culture and this could lead to clashes between them. However, they are unaware that these issues have solutions. The local government or community members can organise induction programs to keep the new comers informed on the land's cultural beliefs. Pamphlets can also be distributed to each immigrant telling them about the cultures of their new society. This way people will learn and respect the culture thereby avoiding unnecessary conflict. In Africa for instance, describing a lady as fat is not conceived as being disrespectful unlike in places in the Europe where it is not tolerated. if one is aware of this one may avoid such words in an environment like that. And this will prevent any misunderstanding that may arise.\n\nHaving a clear understanding of both cultures makes it easier for people to become accommodating, but could this be the benefits? No. When people with different background live together they share knowledge and skills from the various culture. This produces new techniques employed in carrying out some specific processes such as building constructions. In addition, it also improves the lifestyle of the community and this generally results in community development.  For example, people from eastern part of Nigeria are generally good entrepreneurs and their migration to places like Lagos has made the state one of the biggest commercial cities of Africa. Indigenes have also been able to learn these skills, and this has resulted in an enormous growth in the state’s income.\n\nIn summary, there are more merit to having a multicultural society if people know how to deal with the issues that may arise. New skills acquisition and community growth are the major advantages when we embrace people with different ethnic background.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, neu ro rang ban dong y voi quan diem rang cac xa hoi da van hoa mang lai nhieu loi ich hon nhuoc diem cho mot quoc gia.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries an increasing number of children are overweight as a result of eating too much fast food. It is necessary for governments to ban selling this kind of food in schools. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"In a few nations, kids are used to eating a lot of junk food, and due to which they tend to gain weight, causing them to be obese. A few populaces think that the government can regulate the availability of such food in educational institutes. In my opinion, the solution should be full-proof.\n\nIn current times, there are various options available in the canteen that a student can replace their lunch pack with, and this can be curbed by enforcing strict guidelines from the government side so that this is regulated uniformly in all institutes. Individual schools can then take up the responsibility to upgrade their eatery menu with more healthy choices in place of junk items. For instance, even if a student wants to trade his or her lunch for something different, it would be replaced by something nutritious. \n\nMoreover, parents play a crucial role in educating the child regarding good food habits, and they can also keep a check on what their child eats while the child is at home. They should not encourage unhealthy food habits that can lead to health-related complications for their kids. For example, homemade food and snacks should be made available at all times so that the infant can have better alternatives to deep-fried and calorie-rich food.\n\nTo conclude, I agree that that the government should prohibit the availability of unhealthy food at schools. However, I believe that this alone would not suffice, as it is also the responsibility of parents to ensure that their child picks up appropriate food habits to stay fit and healthy.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co nhung y tuong chinh lien quan den viec can cho chinh phu can thiep de han che viec ban thuc an khong lanh manh trong truong hoc va vai tro quan trong cua phu huynh trong viec giao duc con cai ve thoi quen an uong lanh manh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online. Is this a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Amidst Covid-19 spread in the world, people were asked to work from home and students had to take their classes online. According to recent discussions, people are considering continuing this trend ahead. But the question arises, Is it beneficial to study from home? Can we replace classroom studies with the ones given online?  In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will discuss the impacts of taking courses online from home.\n\nTo begin with, According to Hindu mythology in India, during the early days of education, students were asked to leave their homes and live the entire period of education with their teachers. While not being in their comfort zone, they lead a disciplined life and were transformed into scholars. On the contrary, things have transformed now. Nowadays it is observed that students wake up and join their classes online without even getting up from their beds due to which a proper concentration is not formed. \n\nHowever, students going to universities not only obtain knowledge on their courses but also develop interpersonal skills which are hard to learn online. Students get to be with other students from diverse cultures and learn a very valuable skill of friendship, these traits can be built provided all are under one roof. Additionally, professors are able to deliver their lessons smoothly without any interruptions which might occur during online classes.\n\nTo conclude, studying on the internet rather than going to universities can be seen as an overall negative development for students. Some of the merits such as saving time during travelling or saving the cost of infrastructure in universities cannot outweigh the demerits.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi phan nao den cau hoi cua de bai, tuy nhien, phan tap trung cua ban la chi nhac den nhung van de kho khan cua viec hoc truc tuyen, trong khi de bai yeu cau ban danh gia viec dua cac khoa hoc len internet la mot phat trien tich cuc hay tieu cuc. \n\nDe cai thien diem nay, ban co the to chuc bai viet cua minh theo cau truc Dong y - Khong dong y.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that the government should not put money on building theatres and sports stadiums. They should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you  agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Education and medical treatment are an indispensable element of society. Many people argue that the judiciary should not invest money on construction of theatres and sports stadiums. Instead they should use the money on medical amenities and education. I concur with them. My inclination is justified further.\nTo begin with the first cause of agreement, it seems that day by day detrimental accidents are increasing. This is to say, if victims do not obtain proper treatment immediately then one would lose his life. Besides excellent medical care would enhance the longevity of people. This is because, citizens will not face critical incidents. For example, people in developed countries have longer life due to magnificent medical care.\nAs we ponder further, another aspect is that education is a vital factor to secure a job in this cutthroat era. By this I mean that, one with advanced education would find job effortlessly than others. The rearmost coherent factor to be considered is that better education would certainly boost up the nation’s economy. To substantiate, Canada has wider economy due to superb education and medical service rendered by local juridic.\nOn the contrary, some people would vote in favour of creation of theatres and stadiums. The top-notch argument they do is that those buildings produce recreation in humans. This is because, people would get relief from routine overstressed work by attending events in theatres. Moreover, this would promote, competitive gaming events in the country in which many people can participate. For, instance, London has many domestic cricket events due to innumerable sports stadiums.\nTo conclude, it can be finally commented that although theatres and stadiums are recreational sources, education, and medical amenities would certainly exacerbate territory’s economy. In addition, advanced medical care would increase life span of individuals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach dua ra nhung ly do tai sao chinh phu nen dau tu vao y te va giao duc hon la xay dung cac khu vuc giai tri.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is important for children to learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.\nTo what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\nWhat sort of punishment should teachers and parents use to teach good behavior to children?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is considered that punishments need to be applied to make youngsters learn between good and bad. I strongly agree with this and will write on the kind of punishment to be allowed in this essay.\n\nOn one hand, I strongly agree that kids should be faced with consequences on the quest to teaching them rights and wrongs because it sends a deep message to them. That is to say, simply explaining and giving pieces of advice to children is not enough as they most times take them for granted but when they are punished for their actions, it gives them a better directive and makes them change their ways. For example, a mathematics teacher in a secondary school confirmed that punishing students for failure to do homework made them punctual at doing it because of fear of consequences. Therefore, youngsters should be reprimanded in other for them to learn between good or bad.\n\nOn the other hand, parents and teachers in schools should engage in non-violent sanctions in trying to shape children's character. That is, discipline that kids are scared of having will pass a piece of clearer information such as; taking their break time in school, restricting from televisions and phones, will make them learn more. For instance, a child who was not taken along for a regular family hangout as a result of their wrong deed will definitely not repeat the act again. So, punishing kids with things they are afraid to lose is the best rather than any physical action.\n\nIn conclusion, punishing a child t make them learn is good as it sends a clearer message, nevertheless, a non-violent kind of teaching should be employed in doing so.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more companies are allowing employees to work at home. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the technology has altered our working style and gave the chance to the employees to do their job duties from home. While some people claim that this has a positive impact for both the companies and the workforce, others argue it has a negative effect on the companies. I agree to some extent with working from home as it has some advantages such as flexibility and disadvantages such as less productivity. This essay will discuss both sides of the arguments and provide a conclusion with my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, there are several advantages linked with working from home. Firstly, working from home reduces the time wasted during the commute. As a result, they will start their work with full power and energy without feel exhausted from the traffic. For example, the workers do not need to awake very early in the morning to go to the office, and they will start working from home with a fresh mind. Secondly, Working from home gives the employee the flexibility to manage their family matters without impacting their performance. By doing this, the workforce will be able to balance between their personal life and professional career.\n\nOn the other hand, working from home has some negative factors. To commence with, employees will lose their motivation during working from home, and they might not give the work the needed importance. As a result, the production might be reduced and the delivery of the tasks will be delayed. In addition, working from office enhance the workforce collaboration and the social life. Due to this, working from home will increase the tension between the employees and impact the task that requires more collaboration between the team members. For instance, some activities need a face to face meeting for brainstorming and discussion, which require all the team members to be in the office.\n\nTo sum up, there is no doubt that working from home has advantages such as flexibility, but it is linked with many disadvantages that impact the productivity of the employees. However, I profoundly believe that the advantages of working from home will be an added value to the companies and the employees, if it is regulated by processes and rules to control it.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban co tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den 2 y kien trai chieu ve viec cho phep nhan vien lam viec tu xa.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Countries are becoming more and more similar because people are able to buy the same products anywhere in the world.\nDo you think this is a positive or negative development?\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"With developing of the world's connection and the ability to access any production regardless of the location of a person, the becoming of some countries similar to each other is not a new topic to be argued. Regarding this phenomenon, I think it is a positive developmend due to the decreasing of discrimination level and formation of one \"nation\".\n\nFirst and foremost, having an opportunity to acquire the same stuff notwithstanding the location will lead to the declining of discrimination in the world. By this, I mean that access of anyone to the products that are trended in developed countries will not make people from the third-world places be marginalized. If everyone's appearance is quite the same, people will have less reasons to judge each other. For instance, nowadays, a plethora of famouse brends , be it Bershka or Zara, have their product around the world. Thus, people do not have to travel to America to buy a new pair of jeans from H&M because they have it in their own country.\n\nAnother point to consider is that being similar to each other can form one intiger society. If all of the countries have quite the same way of wearing clothes, consuming products, it can lead to the reaching of one of the Sustainable Development Goals formated by UNESCO. The main idea of SDG is to be Global Citizens, since we are living in(on) one planet. Therefore, people should not think that they are belonging to one particular country and think beyond the borders. If those happen, people can solve any problem that currently occures in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that purchasing of the same products all over the world which makes more contries have less (fewer) differences between each other can be seen as a positive development. In conseqence, this leads people to not discriminate and be one unit.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people believe that big businesses in addition to generating profits should be involved in and responsible for the social life of the community. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Large companies have always attempted to come into money; however, the issue of businesses' social compulsory responsibilities is a controversial issue among people. Personally, I entirely agree with the viewpoint that businesses have to do more for the community than make money, and I will explain why in this essay.\n\nIf large companies should take participate in social life in society, by fair and impartial looking, it could have some two-way profits for both businesses and the communities. This is the fundamental idea which its reasons are categorized into three main parts. First, Since people might not apprehend that all large companies are run with the sole purpose of marketing as much advantage as possible for their own, businesses could gain people's trust and foster them to invest their money in their projects. As an example, companies could replace their prioritization from economic growth with gaining people's satisfaction. \n\nSecond, marketing development is the other advantageous consequence. It is notable, for instance, that it could offer a chance for discovering young people's talents who could not be a going concern on their own. Since businesses have to emphasize innovation and creativity in order to survive in a competitive world, they could hire talented young people, which is profitable for both sides. Third, it is generally accepted that thriving the community is imperative for a successful business. In other words, it seems that most of the prosperous activities flourish in a bustling atmosphere. So, if large companies are involved in society, they could indirectly create effective circumstances for their companies' future of business.\n\nIn summary, it might be said that expecting social obligations for large businesses in society is unacceptable because it is the government's responsibility for social supports, and companies should not take charge of it. However, it seems that the effects of this approach appear to be overwhelmingly positive, and its two-way beneficial impacts of the large companies and the communities are undeniable.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va ho tro quan diem cua ban voi nhung lap luan thuyet phuc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays museums have become more and more important. What are the purposes of places such as museums and how should they be funded?\"\nEssay:\n\"Currently, people are prone to be fading away and even be jeopardized by conventional architectures. Hence, there are several purposes for museums and galleries and a series of steps being taken are expected to preserve and strengthen the importance of these traditional buildings.\nAt the outset, the main function of museums and galleries is to demonstrate local citizens the fact regarding their ancestors’ lifestyle, traditional heritages, as well as local cultures. In other words, it is also one of the best means to educate children by the way that it creates a favorable condition for teenagers to gain deeper insight into the sacrifice of our predecessors and cultivate patriotism. Meanwhile, by enhancing the statue of museums domestic economy and countries’ image will be promoted because of the traveling industry which could appeal to a surge growth number of worldwide tourists by the charm of local architectures.\nEncountering these potential targets, the governments have to take steps to preserve and upgrade these traditional values. Firstly, Governments could invest a large amount of money on social media such as TV or newspaper to promote museums and galleries image to emphasize the merits the traditional buildings bring and restore the appearance of it. Moreover, it could raise a citizen’s awareness of traditional identities. Besides, in terms of educating the next generation well, the government should spare no efforts to set up an educational fund. Authorities, for instance, could organize adolescences to visit it, and advocate that only by face-to-face could they appreciate the real values of culture and spirits in their country, and enjoy the historical and aesthetic atmosphere in the conventional architectures.\nIn my conclusion, without these conventional architectures, we would lose valuable treasures and are likely to be at a loss under the background of globalization when overseas cultures intrude. Consequently, nothing is more important to make a considerable investment fund on traditional buildings.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, noi dung chinh la tra loi cau hoi de bai vi ban da ban ve nhung muc dich cua viec thanh lap cac bao tang va loi khuyen ve cach tai tro cho chung.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY ALL JOBS WILL BE DONE BY ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT ROBOTS. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION?\"\nEssay:\n\"These days with the advent of new technologies such as AI, a lot of people have lost their businesses and have been replaced by them. Someone may say that this process will continue, resulting in the loose of all the jobs. While others say that there are professions that only living humans can do. I agree with the latter opinion and process this view in this essay.\n\nMost importantly, professions dealing with feelings are difficult to be managed by AI. It is a privilege for human beings to be moved, shocked or angry and needless to say, those emotions can not be understood by artificially made things. For example, jobs such as mental counsellors can not be replaced. This is because there are no patterns or concrete solutions that can be applied to a mental problem. Problems regarding sentiments are always different and so the solutions are uncountable like stars. It is impossible for AI to deal with it using a pattern programmed previously. \n\nOn the other hand, someone may say that if we give all the accumulated information about a job, AI will be able to run the work. I agree to some extent but the more jobs AI steals, the more works people will nurture. AI is special in that it can use effectively all the past information. However, it is unable to make new things because it lacks creativity. Therefore, only humans are able to make innovations and innovative jobs can not be replaced by humans. \n\nIn conclusion, AI will never replace all jobs because it can not understand feelings and give birth to innovations.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach dua ra quan diem rang khong tat ca cac cong viec se bi thay the boi Robot thong minh (va ban da cho ly do vi sao trong bai viet cua minh).

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays it is common for people to get married and have children in their thirties rather than when they are younger. Do you agree or disagree that this trend will benefit society?\"\nEssay:\n\"Now people get married and have children in their thirties which is much later compared to the past. I personally agree that this trend will benefit society. In the following essay, I will discuss the reasons why I agree with the given statement with examples.\n\nFirst of all, getting married and having children in their thirties is more stable economically. People spend more time on working and saving money. As a result, parents can provide for their children with a better educational environment. For example, my friend got married at 30 years old and she is living with her baby. In addition, my friend lived a stable life and peace so she did not try to work harder. In particular, her job was economically stable enough too. This provides for children opportunities in which they can have a good educational environment and whatever to do. \n\nSecondly, if people get married and have children in their thirties, they permit success in individual work and enlarge their career time. This can make them feel happy in their workplace. For instance, my sister got married at 20 years old so she couldn't go to university because she raised their children all the time. To be specific, she was not earning enough economically. Through this situation, she had not enough time to rest and could not have her career. That is, if she got married at 30 years old, she would be happier and have more free time. \n\nIn conclusion, I agree with these statements because people who get married and have their baby in their thirties are more stable economically and can build their careers.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai luan cua ban, phan Task Response chua mot so y khac voi chu de cau hoi va duong nhu khong tra loi duoc cau hoi nhu mong doi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that dangerous sport should be banned others however believe that people should be free to choose sport activities. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, people do many type of sports depend on their times, money, or passions. There are popular sports like running, cycling, jogging, and swimming. Everyone must have done that at least once in their life. On the other hand, there are also uncommon physical exercises such as big wave surfing, bull riding, base jumping, or boxing. High injury rate in every year made it classified as dangerous and some people agree it should be forbidden. In my opinion, I disagree with that idea and this essay will explain my point of views.\n\nSome people would agree with that thought because they are really care with the person they loved. They want to make sure their kids, parents, wife or husband have a beautiful life, a healthy body and not injured due to doing their hobbies. If someone got injured, it may need a lot of money to take care of and definitely need times for recovery.\n\nBut despite the facts, most people including me believe it is one of the ways to live our life. We need some adrenalines and escape from our routines. Those unusual sports made us enjoy our life and be blessing for having another day to live and having a beautiful family around us. We believe it helps us to release our mood and negative minds. As long as we use protections, the professionals acompanies us, and have knowledge about it, everything will be fine.\n\nTo sum up, people who choose those risky actions should be careful, have evaluated the protocol, and  taking more time to learn. So, after doing that they can go home and meet with their family who are waiting for them.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, Task Response duoc dap ung day du va ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that advertising encourages us to buy things we really do not need. Others say that advertisements tell us about new products that may improve our lives. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.\"\nEssay:\n\"Promoting their products through various channels has been always the most popular tool for the companies to sell their products. Although some people believe that we can discover new merchandise via marketing, I personally agree that the advertisement has the power of convincing people to purchase unnecessary items.\n\nOn the one hand, advertisement is required to allow people to learn about the products that can be beneficial to them. Some items specifically made for target audience may not be found in the neighbourhood stores. As a consequence of the development of online marketing, people from all around the world have access to a wide range of products and they can effortlessly order them online.  For instance, my mother has diabetes and she has been dealing with some challenges such as non-healing wounds that come with this disease. One day we saw a TV ad about a scar cream that was specifically produced for diabetes patients. We ordered that cream online and she has been satisfied with the results. I can say that it helped her greatly. If we did not see the on-screen ad about this cream, she would not have had the chance to heal her scars.\n\nOn the other hand, marketing has the power of convincing people to purchase the items they do not necessarily require. There are a great number of various products’ promotions on social media, TV and radio. Doubtlessly, we can say that most of these products are not there in aid of people but for the companies’ profit. Additionally, they are designed to create spending temptation. It is hard to withstand especially the discounts or offers accompanying these products. For example, although I create a shopping list every time before I do grocery shopping, I end up buying more items for the reason that the flyers I receive push me to purchase more than I need. There are so many discounts, offers I come across that if I do not take advantage of them, I feel like I would lose a great deal. This is the power that the advertising companies have over us.\n\nIn conclusion, although the product promotion have advantages such as helping people find out the items that are beneficial to them, more often than not it triggers people to spend money on the items that they are not in need of.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, noi dung duoc trinh bay rat ro rang va tuong minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries it is thought advisable that children begin formal education at four years old, while in others they do not have to start school until they are seven or eight.\n\nHow far do you agree with either of these views?\n\"\nEssay:\n\"Age is a vital factor for children to learn. It is stated that children in some countries begin their formal education when they are four years old. Conversely, others started school at seven or eight years old. Personally, children should start learning at the age of seven. Their brain is ready for learning at this age. Children at seven will Study more effectively. There are reasons to support this view. \n\nTo start with, Children at seven have a higher ability to learn. They are grown up enough for learning and understanding efficiently. Since their brain is developed enough to distinguish situations, they can learn with more comprehension. They are able to take better advantages from their brain at this age. When their brain is developed, they will be able to gain a lot of advantages from that. They can comprehend easy things faster than those who start to learn at a young age. This means that starting to teach children at age of seven will provide more advantages for children. \n\nNext, children at this age will be able to control and manage their stress and behavior while studying. This is an essential reason because they need to be able to focus particularly on their task. They can manage their emotions while learning. This cannot be taught to kids at four. They are too young to control their behavior and emotions in the classroom. Therefore, pupils at the age of seven can control themselves to focus on lessons. This means that children at seven will have enough maturity to control themselves.  \n\nOn the other hand, some countries send kids to go on formal education while they are just four. This can motivate children to learn since they were young. They can be taught the skill of learning at a young age, so they can learn more easily when they are grown up. However, the age of four should be a period of playing and entertaining. Since at this age it is too complicated for kids to learn in a formal lesson. Therefore, it is not the right time to send them to school. \n\nIn conclusion, children should be taught in a formal lesson when they are seven. Kids at this age have a higher ability to learn. Their brain is developed enough to comprehend the lesson. In addition, they are grown enough to control themselves while learning. Children at age four are not grown enough to control themselves.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

I personally agree with this matter. The reasons why I believe will be addressed in this passage.\n\nThe most important reason why I advocate this notion is that all investigations need to be funded, in other words, the government should consider some budgets for doing them and this money has been collected from the people. For example, annually the individuals have to pay taxation and as a result, they would be entitled to benefit from the outcomes of the science. Without no money, the scientists will not be able to fulfil their purposes in their projects and they will fail undoubtedly.\n\nAnother substantial reason for this opinion is that we are living in a fast-changing world and science plays a vital role in people’s lives. This role can be classified in various aspects. Firstly, technology can help people to benefit from various equipment, for example, computers, smartphones and the Internet. Secondly, science is able to investigate healthcare facilities and introduce new medications to the people perfectly.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, women, as well as men, work full-time. Therefore, women and men should share household tasks equally. (e.g. cleaning and looking after children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\"\nEssay:\n\"Recent trends show that both men and women are working full-time compared to older days. Some people think that men cannot do most of the household tasks, whereas others argue that men should equally do work at home to help women. Balancing the household tasks equally for both is always debatable. \n\nTo begin with, men always feel that they are responsible for managing the economic situation of the family such as daily needs, expenses, children's education and financial growth. So this contributes to men's mindset to focus on the financial stability of the family. Although women are responsible for children's needs, cooking, washing clothes and cleaning etc. For example these factor affects the recent days, where women are equally contributing to the family by working full time and managing household work is quite difficult these days. \n\nOn the other hand, mature people think that they are equally responsible for household work to help women to be more balanced inside and outside the home. These people help out with cleaning, teaching kids, washing clothes, etc. where women need help with their day-to-day activities. Hence balancing  work at home would help to have a peaceful and understanding life between couples to avoid misunderstandings or conflicts. My colleagues experienced problems when they do not share the workload at home due to women facing more workloads and suffering. \n\nTo conclude, I strongly agree that men should equally share the tasks with women at home to lead a peaceful and healthy life. With the growing culture of women working full-time and it would continue for future years, men should understand the difficulty and support women the most in the living location.\n\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach thao luan ve viec chia se cong viec gia dinh giua nam gioi va phu nu.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In today’s very competitive world, a worker has to possess multiple skills to succeed.  Among the skills that a worker should possess, which skill do you think is more important, social skills or good qualifications?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the business sector has become more competitive than in the past. This means that  employers call for being more talented in socialisation and being strongly educated. In my opinion, having social skills are more vital compared to good qualifications in this century. In this essay, what are the benefits of being social in business competition will be explained in the coming paragraph with a logical conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, the last 2 decades have witnessed bizarre circumstances in some companies. People who work to choose employment forget to be stigmatised when they make a core decision. They believe that candidates who have a huge network suit  this position. For example, getting a job in countries which have an awful economy (including Turkiye, Bulgaria, and Macedonia) is so tough as you need to have close ties like family members. Hence, many people who have a high educational level might be unemployed with this inequality. This could be seemed notas  a social skill, however, it really high-level  interaction skill according to these poor countries.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers point out that introverted people with good qualifications are struggling to find work. Because  a lack of communication skills promotes showing their talents in their own subject. Therefore, this situation chips away at their self-confidence and they could be more asocial than before. Businesses are a sea, and this sea is becoming more and more deeper for people who have social anxiety.\n\nIn conclusion, both qualification and socialisation are significant to be in a race with competitors. Nevertheless,the advantage of having a good bridge with others outweigh the benefit of being educated. I hope  this issue will be fixed by the governments in the future and people might assess via equal standards.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dung la tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"housing is essential for people. some argue that government should offer free housing for people who cannot afford it. do you agree r disagree with this statement?\"\nEssay:\n\"To live securely and safely, we all need a home. It is our basic need. Some minds claim that a place for living for people who are unable to afford a house should be offered by the government, however, others claim that it should not be provided by the government. I firmly agree with the former notion because of many reasons.\n\nThe first and foremost is that for the protection of the individuals in the country, it is the duty of the authority to provide a free place for the impoverished to live in which shows the positive attitude of management for the people. To illustrate, there are countries such as Canada, India and many more that are providing free-of-cost houses for underprivileged families. Secondly, caring for local people is the duty of authority and by doing this, people will believe that the government is taking care of its residents.\n\nMoving further, the count of death and disease will be reduced when all people have homes as it protects us from extreme weather conditions such as heat, snow storms, cold, rain and many more. For example, people who don't have a home because of money,  have to live on streets or roads which will prone them to get diseases or a reason for death as well. Furthermore, others will also follow this plan so their residents don't have any trouble living in the country.\n\nTo sum up, there is no doubt free housing will affect the budget of government but owing to a number of reasons to provide homes without money to impoverished nationals such as the safety and security of the population, the positive attitude of the country towards its citizens and the harmony of the nation.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In order to learn a language well, we should also learn about the country as well as the cultures and lifestyles of the people who speak it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"There are a variety of languages existing throughout the world. As humans, we have progressed a long way creating bridges for communication among various tribes. As an avid learner of languages, it is essential to understand the country's culture and its people's lifestyle. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay, we will discuss two important points that demonstrate without exploring the details of the origin of a language; it's challenging to comprehend the correct form.\n\nIf we talk about ancient languages - signs and symbols used by our ancestors, the stone age people, it's fundamental to understand their lifestyle and culture. For instance, it would be difficult to transfer the knowledge they gained and carve on stones without understanding how they live and what they do. In fact, the stone painting would be all gibberish if we failed to understand their civilization and way of living.\n\nIf we talk about modern vocabulary, they all have idioms to express situations in phrases. For example, raining cats and dogs - a situation in the past when after heavy rainfall, all the poor helpless creatures die because of floods. Failing to learn the origin of idioms, we will struggle to use them correctly, hence failing to use the language correctly. Moreover,  grammar used in the language is deeply rooted in the culture and lifestyle of the people of any nation. Such as, in Hindi, every noun has a gender; to use it correctly, you must understand the culture.\n\nIn conclusion, we discussed how culture and lifestyle profoundly impact the language spoken throughout the country.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"some people believe that social skills are as important as good qualifications for job success. To what extend do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"the staff is pivotal to the success of any job. to achieve job progression, one must possess strong social skills in addition to work experience. given that work and communication are interdependent with each other, I firmly believe that social skills and qualifications are equally essential for job success. \n\nin a workplace, social skills are crucial for successful teamwork. they allow individuals to work effectively with each other, share and discuss ideas, practice creativity, resolve conflicts, and form a positive work environment. besides, it helps alleviate work stress. taking a break from work to socialize with colleagues and connect can provide mental and physical refreshment, and promote work-life balance.  also, in order to strengthen the relationship with other employees traits like empathy, compassion, respect, and honesty are as vital as other mentioned skills. skills like these help an individual cope in the real world, which an academic degree does not offer. \n\nif the recruitment process is only focused on the qualification of an individual, then it results in hiring employees who are inadequate to show effective work results due to their lack of social skills. candidates with poor social skills often struggle to adapt to new environments, engage in teamwork, voice their ideas or concern, cooperate with others, and maintain a healthy relationship. these people often feel helpless and are hesitant to ask for help. As a result, they are easily agitated and unsuccessful to increase their productivity. actions like these hinders work advancement and lower the company's reputation. consequently, they are either fired from their jobs or transferred to another sector. \n\nundoubtedly, academic qualifications are also important because despite having essential social skills, one will fail inevitably if one does not have the required skills to solve a problem. qualifications indicate a person's education level and how much depth a person's knowledge has. it most definitely helps a recruiter in hiring suitable candidates. \n\nto conclude, the mentioned advantage of social skills helps a person to grow confident in their work and progress. in the modern era, more people are coming to this realization and putting equal weight on possessing social skills in addition to having good academic qualifications.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi day du cau hoi de bai:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai vi ban da the hien quan diem ro rang ve viec social skills (ky nang xa hoi) cung quan trong voi good qualifications (bang cap tot) doi voi su thanh cong trong cong viec.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Thanks to developments in technology, many people today have lost basic skills such as how to repair clothes, etc. Why is this happening? Do you think that this is a negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Technology has transformed our world in all aspects. While it has brought forward the biggest revolution in the form of the internet, on the other hand, it has provided us with different machines that have made many of our day-to-day tasks easy. However, there is a general perception that it has made people forget about some basic life skills . In  the following paragraphs, I would like to shed some light on the bases of such thoughts.\n\nFirst of all, as we all know  technology has made our lives easier in many ways and humans have worked hard for years to acquire this all. For example, we have now automated washing machines and dishwasher present in our homes that can do the work in minutes for us without any hassle. So. basically in my view, it is only about utilising the best facilities and it is not in any way related to laziness or lack of skills. Individuals are just thriving to save their time , so they can invest it in the  better side but a lot of personages from old generation regarded it as a lack of interest in life skills.\n\nFurthermore, the internet has opened many new doors for learning and mastering new techniques of all types. For instance, girls can cook from easy cooking videos and teachers can get ideas for many artworks. Students can take online lectures and online workshops that can help them in mastering many skills.  Therefore, instead of making individuals lazy and raw, it is actually polishing them in the long run\n\nTo sum up, it can be concluded with full confidence that advancement has literally brought the best for us. Now, it is our responsibility to use it for a positive impact and avoid any misuse. We should also try to learn not to be always dependent on anything but we should make the most of the facilities we have now.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai voi viec trinh bay quan diem cua minh ve viec cong nghe da lam mat di nhung ky nang co ban nhu sua chua quan ao.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parent's home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a home with friends. Do you agree or disagree with this approach. Give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Young children in developed countries have the mentality to live separately from their parent's homes as soon as they have finished school. Many of them decide to live alone whereas, some of them choose to live in a dwelling with mates. I strongly disagree with this advancement. This essay will explain the differences along with my perspective in the upcoming paragraphs. \n\nTo commence with, privacy is one of the major concerns of young children by leaving their homes at a very young age. They believe that they are mature enough to take decisions. They think that their parents have no right to rule their life. Moreover, differences between the parents will push them to live separately. For example, Toronto is one of the high-profile cities in Canada, 98 % of youth in Toronto city live alone. Governments of such countries allow children to work part-time after the age of 18. Therefore, they get the opportunity to work and handle expenses on their own.\n\nOn the other hand, affection is another reason that children are unable to leave their homes. They get attached to their family, as they lived more than 16 years over there. It is hard to leave your parents and start everything in a new way. For example, according to a doctor's theory, parents are the only stable need of a child that will last forever in his whole life. Thus, living by self is optional, but moving from a family is a big responsibility for a child to tackle everything alone.\n\nI opine that parents present their role very effectively. It is their child's duty to settle down things when they get matured. They sacrifice their whole life to nourish their children, leaving them, at last,last is not the right choice.\n\nTo summarise, millions of positive points will not hide the drawbacks of living alone or settling things on their own.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, dong vai tro la mot quan ly chu de tot.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the future, robots will do more and more jobs instead of humans. Does this development have more advantages or disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, many companies have developed computer systems and created working robots for multiple purposes. Some people believe that this technology may help them to work effectively, while some people argue that there are many negative effects of programming robots which do more jobs instead of humans. Not only this essay will explain the benefits and drawbacks of this development, but it also supports that this technology should not replace human jobs.\n\nTo begin with, artificial intelligence programs will support many companies, such as food industries and hardware manufacturers. Programming robots may work faster than human at a constant rate, and this lead to more productivity for companies. Moreover, programming machines may keep the product quality. For example, the food industry has been using robots to prepare their frozen products, which can keep the quality of the size of cutting meat, and provide the constant speed of processing. Although this technology may develop robots to help many industries, there are more tasks that can not replace by machines.\n\nOn the other hand, many fields have some robotics to be used as their support, but robots cannot do many creative works, critical thinking skills, and hands-on procedures. During this new development, there are many companies have been using robots to create artwork, but the result is not satisfactory yet. Therefore, the style of art may copy from other artists and lack creativity. Furthermore, some people try to use robots in medical fields, including helping doctors diagnose the disease, but they still lack the accuracy to understand the complications. Many practical skills are required for specialists to do these works.\n\nIn conclusion, using robots will be helpful in many ways, such as for mass production and standard manufacturing. While programming robots can help many companies, creative works and medical fields are required humans to do these tasks. This essay provides the idea that there are more disadvantages to this development.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ra uu diem va nhuoc diem cua viec su dung robot.\n- Tuy nhien, y tuong cua ban co the duoc mo rong day du hon bang cach cung cap cac vi du va lap luan them de lam ro quan diem cua ban.\n- Can them cac vi du cu the va ly luan thuyet phuc de chung minh ca uu diem va nhuoc diem cua viec su dung robot.\n\nCac diem can duoc cai thien co the bao gom:\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is often said that to become a successful business a tertiary education is not at all necessary. To what extent you agree or disagree. Give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Education is a key for being profitable and it is cumbersome to lead a job market without it; however there are some who believe that higher education is not essential to grow in any business field. Personally, I am not totally agree with this idea and this essay will discuss my point of view in the following paragraphs, including some examples from my own experience.\n\nAt the outset, nowadays,  business is considered one of the most famous and prospering types of work, as well as qualifications on business administration is growing day by day. Most people are striving to have own occupation because of its convenience and flexibility. Even the graduates change their career direction to business administrartion if they are dissatisfied with their qualifications. Likewise, most universities offer a program which named Master of Business Administration for this reason as well as the amount of novices have increasing who tends to choose this faculty. For instance, the study which has taken in Germany shows that this program peaked hit  education rates for last 5 years.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of individuals insist on the idea that anyone can accomplish in personal marketing career without higher education. They claim that tuition has affect in specific career areas, such as education, health. but not marketing.  Furthermore, with support of technology, being successful in business career is easier than previous years. To exemplify, two decades ago, people could make an advertisement solely on TV or radio to gain profit from their business, in contrast now social media gives them a great chance to flourish on their personal area.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the role of education is undeniable in any field from engineering to sculpturing. It provides coaching which all professionals need to fall depth of occupation. To personify, I initially was working as a teacher, as well as I had small business on jewellery. However, I didn't have income which I wish. Therefore, I decided to study in The Master of Business Administration and subsequently, I learned many secrets to become lucky businesswoman.\n\nIn a nutshell, related with our modern era, it is not tough to tackle with rising of amount in the private marketing. Otherwise, universities, training programs and practicing could have more out-turn to be professional businessman.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban da doi dap dung vao de bai va trinh bay quan diem ro rang, nhu yeu cau cua de bai.\n- Tuy nhien, ban co the da cung cap them cac ly do hoac lap luan cu the hon de ung ho quan diem cua minh.\n- Them vao do, ban co the da nhan thuc duoc quan diem trai nguoc va dua ra mot lap luan phan bien de cung co quan diem cua minh.\n\nNhan xet them:\nNeu ban muon nang cao Task Response cua bai viet, hay xem xet ap dung cac buoc sau:\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that young people who commit serious crimes，such as a robbery or a violent attack should be punished in the same way as adults. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Some individuals opine that underage children who are barely 18 years of age should be sentenced the exact same as mature people who have been charged with unavoidable offences, such as mugging or serious physical threats. I strongly disagree with this concept. This essay will explain the differences along with my perspective in upcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo commence with, people who agreed with the statement believe that illegal acts should not be ignored. It can only hike the crime rate. Generally, young children mostly follow other people, they are unaware of the consequences of their actions. For instance, a mother and her one-year-old child were smashed on the road by a group of 16 years old boys due to unbalanced the vehicle because of high speeding. The boy who drove that vehicle was sentenced to 17 years in prison. Therefore, guilt should be punished, so it will not spread. \n\nOn the other hand, some citizens disagree with the statement, young children are the youth of the country. Harsh punishments will destroy their innocence. It will not only destroy their Present but also the future. Everyone needs one chance to prove themselves. Most of the mistakes are not planned, they just happened coincidently. For example, as per a survey, 90 % of doctors believe that the human soul is innocent, until, it will be threatened for reasons. It depends on every personality what they want to become. They will be harsher by getting harsh treatment.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that young people who commit serious crimes，such as a robbery or a violent attack should be punished in the same way as adults. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Few people think that juveniles should be punished the same as adults for doing serious crimes like robbery and mudders. I disagree with this statement because everyone deserves a second chance  and another reason is if they share the same bars with serious criminals then they become like them.\n\nFirst, youngsters do many crimes to become famous or some crimes for in their innocence therefore, they need second chance to take their life back on track because they have left their whole life in front of them so, they have time to change their life and also could serve for a country in future. For example,  many jails  allow their prisoners to learn some skill work and make the products and sell in the market which allow them to catch up with other people and also people accept them.\n\nSecond, some young people are not serious offenders if they are treated same like put in same jails as the other offender do then they cut off themselves from the world and push themselves towards  crime which will be dangerous for  society because they mix up with criminals and learn things from them and most importantly, they find new connections and links with other criminals which whitewash their brains and use them for their own purposes.for instance ,In recent survey, 70% of young children became big criminals who were rejected by society then they met with bad people and used by them.\n\nIn conclusion, although punishment is important for any offender to make a fear in their mind, it is not a permanent solution  if people really want to change someone they should accept them and try to improve them on their mistakes rather than giving punishment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi mot phan cua cau hoi de bai, trong khi ban de cap den quan diem cua minh rang tre em khong nen bi trung phat nhu nguoi lon, ban khong ro rang neu rang ban dong y hoac khong dong y voi viec tre em bi trung phat nhu nguoi lon mot cach ro rang. \n\nY tuong trong bai viet cua ban cung chua duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays it is more difficult for children to concentrate or pay attention in schools. What could be the reasons for this? What solutions can you suggest?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent times, children have lower attention spans than in the past. This may be due to many reasons but I will be highlighting the main ones in this essay.\n\nWith the advance in technology, gadgets such as tablets and computers have become a common item in every household. Therefore, with the development of apps and games, most parents allow access to them as it gives parents a way to keep children busy. Moreover, these games are designed to give users quick bursts of dopamine which cause children, as well as adults, to be occupied for short game sessions. For example, flappy bird was a famous game which relied on users to tap the screen at the correct time which varied constantly but not exceeding more than a second. Consequently, harming their ability to concentrate for prolonged periods. \n\nThere are limited ways to solve this issue. One way would be for parents to set specific tasks to children within a certain time frame. For instance, clean their room in one hour. This would allow them to avoid procrastination and be focused on the task in hand. Admittedly, this would not be able to work every time but eventually they would develop discipline over time and be able to increase their attention span. \n\nIn conclusion, being able to stay focused is a problem for many children in modern society.

While  some individuals believe that it's essential to focus on their main field books instead of wasting time  learning other trades too. In my ,view it is wise to have an overview of another discipline too.\n\nOn the one hand, quite a number of students are interested in more open and versatile fashion by involving themself in a high range of subjects. Firstly, it's very important to have an understanding of different subjects in this contemporary world for better opportunities. To be precise, Few students have a plan for further study with different syllabi and it's always beneficial for them to devote some time to get a basic understanding in advance. For example, many engineers study engineering books and side by side also take a glimpse of management courses for their future. Moreover, this phenomenon is useful in office culture too, as project management gives more preference to  versatile people to take care of numerous responsibilities. Hence, having a knowledge of multiple areas very essential for the young generation to grow in their future study and carrier.\n\non the other hand, Some people  emphasise focusing on specific subjects instead of jacking on all trades. In this technology world study curriculum is already too much overloaded and covering all tasks and projects within a given timeline really requires lots of time and dedication. To elaborate, students who enrolled for medical and science schemes have super large syllabi and huge competition. It is essential to pay attention to respected relevant subjects to achieve better rank for better placement or Jobs. Apart from that, few professionals advised you to focus on a specific path to become the master, so you can perform best in that. \n\nTo Conclude, Although, a significant number of students adopt  the culture of reading many trades to get versatile knowledge.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people decide to start their own busniess instead of working hour for a company or organization. Do the advantages for people working for their own business outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"These days, the majority of the masses prefer to initiate their own work, rather than being employed at others` places. From my perspective, it has more benefits than drawbacks, and both would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo commence with, the young generation wants to become freelancers as they feel this would provide a plethora of advantages. To begin with, they could do their job as per their own conditions and could provide job opportunities to others. In other words, they do not like to be bound  to employment from nine to seven, in fact, do not even like to follow the guidelines and rules of the workplace. Besides, they could earn much more profit in this manner, they need not  do hard work for others. For instance, while a person is being employed in an organisation, he would receive only hourly wage, no matter, if he had worked extra. Therefore, inhabitants, who do not like to share their earnings, or are restricted by regulations want to invest in their business merely.\n\nOn the other hand, self-employed individuals need to face some challenges as well. Initially, they need to devote extra hours, especially at the earliest stages, whilst the earnings are quite low. Subsequently, some refuse to pursue it further, as they develop a fear of the risk involved in it. For example, business tycoons frequently talk about stress  and failures of their initiatives, they had to face obstacles, disappointments and loses they had to due to a few errors. Apart from this, they cannot enjoy the benefits that organizations provide to their employees, including health insurance, paid vacations, bonuses and certainly more. \n\nIn conclusion, apparently, starting a new job costs huge sacrifices and dedication, however, once it would become a successful empire it could provide comfort and relaxation along with money. Although  it has a few downsides, I consider its pros are much more.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ra ca mat loi va mat hai cua viec lam viec cho cong ty ca nhan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think schools should group pupils according to their academic ability, but others believe pupils with different abilities should be educated together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Different academic abilities exist among students, according to discipline, intelligence, and hard work. Some schools believe students should be grouped into different levels, depending on academic performance, while others disagree. In my view, this should never happen, as it induces numerous issues in both classes. The following paragraphs will explore both sides of the argument and highlight why I support one side.\n\nIndeed, overachievers feel underwhelmed when faced with the workload average pupils receive. It simply does not satisfy them to know they have locked potential, all due to their fellow classmates’ inability to match their own standards. Above average students tend to feel more hungry for knowledge, looking for an actual challenge, which is somewhat understandable. By dividing a class into two, that could be achieved. Instant fiery competitiveness is induced between the overachieving classmates. Likewise, longer hours of teaching the academically average group makes a lot of sense, to ensure they understood the topic and to address any questions they may have. In addition to that, the A+ group can be introduced to advanced level topics, in order to fully unleash their potential, and satisfy their hunger for knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, new problems show up once a class of supposedly the same grade, is split up into two categories. This, essentially, implies to the classmates that there is a superior group and a dumb one. Consequently, members of the “dumb class” will feel inadequate, and immediately lose self-esteem and thus, their motivation. On top of that, the upper division will most likely adopt a superiority complex that leads to looking down upon their peers. A larger workload of homework is bound to inspire a feeling of unfairness among the lower level, as well as applying pressure on the higher level to naturally acquire that knowledge without the same amount of homework. To make the situation further complicated, not every school can afford paying double the salary for each grade.\n\nIn conclusion, natural excellence is a blessing and a curse in disguise. While the academically blessed may score large numbers in tests, they feel bored being in the same classroom as less fortunate peers. Dividing the two solves that, while causing even greater problems, such as insecurity or lack of motivation. My opinion, ultimately, is that splitting colleagues of the same grade into two is harmful more than is helpful.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da mo rong y tuong cua minh day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"What are the pros and cons for children of watching television?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, most people have televisions at home as they have become an important part of our lives like smartphones or tablets. As a result, a great number of children are fond of watching cartoons or family films on TV. There are both advantages and disadvantages to this. In this ,essay I am going to examine how kids benefit from televisions and what drawbacks there are.\n\nFirst of all, watching TV can be beneficial for children's development as there are millions of programmes with educational elements. Besides specific programmes with the only aim to teach a kid something about the natural world or literacy, there are family films. Not only do they entertain children but also introduce them to the basics of  life such as kindness, tolerance and love. \n\nAnother advantage for kids watching TV is that they can obtain patience. The ability to sit still is very useful since it can come in handy at school, college or even work. What is more, when youngsters watch movies or animated movies, they learn to focus all their attention on the screen which can help them to develop concentration.\n\nHowever, according to  scientific ,research it is proven that watching television is harmful to the eyes. Consequently, spending a lot of time in front of a TV screen can lead to visual impairment, which is a common problem among young people. \n\nFurthermore, television can be addictive ,especially for little boys and girls. A lot of parents use cartoons as a way to calm their youngsters, which can result in a child's obsession with TV. In this case, a youngster becomes more interested in the imaginary world, shown in films and animated movies than in reality. Finally, a child can find it hard to socialize in the community.\n\nTo sum up, watching TV can be both advantageous and disadvantageous for kids, as they can learn something new but it can result in worsening of their eyesight. Following this, the pros overweight the cons since parents can control the amount of time their infants spend in front of the screen in order to prevent negative effects.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response:\n\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai \"What are the pros and cons for children of watching television?\" bang viec neu ra ca loi va hai cua viec tre em xem TV.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, a growing number of people with health problems are trying alternative medicines and treatments instead of visiting their usual doctor.\n\nDo you think this is a positive or a negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the ages of developing medicine, majority of people prefer to cure their diseases with new, different methods of treatment. Only small number of people go to their usual doctors,though, I do believe there is nothing negative in seeking unconventional methods of treating if people want so\n\nToday medicine is improving from day to day, doctors and proffesors try to find quicker and easier way of treating various diseases. Therefore people want to cure their health problems via these modern methods. It is completely normal as sometimes usual doctors cannot help and people need to find another way to solve health problems. There are a lot of examples when untraditional treatment helps people to win disease. For instance, Medical Center in Uzbekistan, which is famous in Central Asia by treating diseases, which doctors could not treat. In 2017, doctors from this medical Centre helped a boy who could not speak by their own special methods. So, sometimes alternative, and strange way treatment can be very useful. \n\nMoreover, in some cases, usual doctors do not have sufficient knowledge about a particular health problem. For example, in Kazakhstan quality of high education is extremely law, even in medical schools. Majority of people are aware about that and therefore give their preference to alternative medicines. However, this development might be incentive for usual medics to be more competent in order to get people's trust. \n\nIn conclusion, people may decide for themselves whether to try alternative treatments or to be content with local doctors. Personally , I feel that it is better to find medicine that will suit them and help them, even if it is unconventional treatment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDiem manh cua bai viet cua ban la ban da tra loi dung vao cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Teenagers should have regular exams at secondary school as this will prepare them better for life after leaving school. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"The education system plays a pivotal role in shaping young minds, equipping them with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in the world beyond school. Among the many components of education, regular examinations have been a subject of debate in recent years. This essay aims to delve into the significance of regular exams for teenagers in secondary school, focusing on how they contribute to preparing students for life after graduation. While some may argue against regular examinations, there is compelling evidence to suggest that they are indeed valuable in fostering critical thinking, time management skills, and developing a sense of accountability.\n\nOne of the key benefits of regular examinations is their ability to foster critical thinking skills among teenagers. Exams require students to think analytically, synthesize information, and apply their understanding to various scenarios. These cognitive processes are essential in preparing them for real-life situations where critical thinking is required, such as problem-solving in the workplace or making informed decisions. Moreover, regular exams encourage students to challenge their own assumptions and develop a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying.\n\nAnother argument in favour of regular examinations at the secondary school level is their ability to instil a sense of accountability in teenagers. Exams provide students with a tangible measure of their progress and performance, as well as a benchmark against which they can evaluate their achievements. This accountability not only motivates them to put in their best effort but also prepares them for the feedback and evaluation systems they may encounter in higher education or the workplace. Furthermore, the sense of accountability cultivated through regular examinations encourages students to take ownership of their learning and sets the stage for a proactive approach to personal growth.\n\nRegular examinations are undeniably valuable in preparing teenagers for the challenges they will face after leaving secondary school. By fostering critical thinking skills, cultivating time management, and instilling a sense of accountability, these exams contribute to the holistic development of students. Even though some may argue against the stress and pressure that exams may bring, it is crucial to recognize that real-life situations often demand individuals to perform under pressure. By implementing regular exams, secondary schools can equip students with the skills necessary to navigate these challenges, empowering them to reach their full potential and succeed in their future endeavours.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCac y tuong cua bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people believe that formal 'pen and paper' examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement.\n\nWhat is your view of examinations?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Some say a paper-based exam format is the most efficient way to measure how successful your educational level is. At the same time, others believe that it will not display a proper result, and there are still other possible options. From my point of view, I strongly agree that there are several alternative methods available that can show an individual’s talent.\n\nIt is widely acceptable that a paper test is a good choice to choose and score your knowledge rank. However, it is not the best way to do it because some are straightforward and can be memorised. When the problem has been adapted to fit into real situations, people cannot solve it since it is not similar to what they are trying to remember. For example, it has been seen quite often that top rank students who usually receive high marks in paper format fail to pass their lab or physical test whenever possible.\n\nMoreover, knowledge level can be measured by understanding how people explain or demonstrate extremely complex things understandably. The reason is that when individuals could not catch up on your points, they will keep asking, and your job is to clarify all their puzzles so you can proudly say that you truly master that topic. For instance, some high schools have admitted that it was sometimes also challenging for them to rap up every bullet point for their kids and ensure that it was simple enough for them to digest.\n\nIn conclusion, while paper exams are one of the good options traditionally used to assess knowledge accomplishment, other methods such as explanation or demonstration can be much more suitable because people always need to deal with unpredictable circumstances. Therefore, I believe other options besides paper-based are more reliable.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response:\n- Tra loi cau hoi de bai: Bai viet cua ban chua truc tiep de cap den \"formal 'pen and paper' examinations\" nhu yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Air travel should be restricted because of pollution and uses up the world's fuel.Do you agree or disagree ?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern era, air travel is by far the most popular form of travel over long distances. Due to the increase in demand, some individuals believe that this form of travel should be limited due to the environmental pollution and the fact that it is diminishing the world’s resources. I firmly believe that the industry should continue to grow to meet demand.\n\nThere is no doubt that as the global market for air travel grows so will the pollution. Therefore, the air we breathe will be less pure and the noise produced would harm our ears over time. Moreover, the large amounts of fuel being used on the aircraft that could potentially be used elsewhere. However, individuals would still need to travel to other countries. Consequently, the fuel and pollution produced by these inconvenient journeys would far exceed the resources used by a traditional airplane.\n\nTravelling by air is the safest form of travel. Therefore, having less flights would increase the number of vehicle collisions, leading to more deaths which would be a disadvantage to any society. For example, a family travelling eight hours by car as opposed to two hours by air are at a much higher risk of being in an accident. Not to mention the rise in traffic congestion which would lead to each trip taking longer, in turn causing more pollution and wasting more fuel.\n\nIn conclusion, air travel is becoming more efficient as time goes on. The travel alternatives to these trips, especially long-haul flights are just not viable on a regular basis. In my opinion, air travel needs to be expanded not restricted.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"To what extent do you agree that people in high positions should get paid more than those in lower positions.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, some people are likely to be paid more in high positions rather than those who are in low positions. This essay displays a personal point of view  regarding  salary payment. Moreover, this support provides reasons why the motion is reasonable for those who read.\n\nFirst thing first, I personally agree people who opt to work in trust-worthy positions should be paid more rather those at the bottom. Furthermore, those who work in higher positions take a huge responsibility on a work basis. Thus, paying them more tends to be the right choice for the company where they work in. Continuously, people who work as CEO and higher have the most overwhelming schedule meaning that they are doing a valuable action for the company. For instance, the CEO needs to handle each division of the company to ensure the company runs as it supposes to. Consequently, those hard work should be paid in lots of budgets.\n\nIn reverse, individuals who have occupations on average to lower basis have less responsibility to do than those who are in upper positions. Paying them with a huge amount of money would be a waste. In addition, a wide range of salaries for the bottom position will harm the company's finance. However, sparing this source of finance should be done wisely.\n\nFinally, I am confident  support that society which takes roles in important positions should be given the rights of society with huge  budgets. On the other hand, those  in less crucial positions are not obligated to be paid more.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Now a days, Many People have to work longer hours, and then feel more stressed out than before. What are the reasons for stress at the workplace? What can employer do to make their employee's life easier?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, it is evident that workers must work overtime sometimes, depending on the needs of the company they work for. This is directly linked to increased stress. The following paragraphs will analyze this problem and the appropriate solutions that may treat it.\n\nUndoubtedly, stress has many possible factors that contribute to it, not necessarily the extra work. However, employers must take action to ensure that the employees are not suffering, as this could lead to their self induced departure from a vital company job. A likely factor could be work overload, together with a demanding boss unwilling to listen to the complaints of the stationed below him in the work hierarchy. On top of that, the feeling of being unable to please your boss no matter what you do is demotivating. To make the situation even more complicated, a lack of breaks certainly worsens matters. It is also possible that the thought of family being away for too long is troublesome to most. Moreover, this eventually leads to homesickness. Last but not least, a noisy environment can never help an already exhausted individual.\n\nConsequently, employers must find ways to help keep a workplace ambient, as well as with high spirit. Almost all issues can be tackled, and this is no exception. To begin with, more frequent gaps between work are bound to refresh the minds of workers. Likewise, the commanding figure should be understanding and mindful of the load everyone is burdened with. Creating relationships with each individual member of the office will lower their anxiety levels significantly. Nonetheless, a member with authority should be firm and serious to keep the workplace running. Motivating the community to go beyond normal office hours is possible, once they are offered rewards for their efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, numerous cause stress exist, including diet, fitness, and other factors unrelated to jobs. Nevertheless, it certainly could be a job that is troubling an individual, whether it is the noisy nature of the area, terrifying leader, or being separated from family. Fortunately, they could be solved by creating a more peaceful atmosphere, with realistic expectations from each member.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach xac dinh nguyen nhan gay stress tai noi lam viec va de xuat giai phap de giup nhan vien co cuoc song de dang hon.\n- Tuy nhien, y tuong cua ban co the duoc mo rong day du hon.

Discuss the possible alarming effects of this problem in the future.\"\nEssay:\n\"Most nations are facing a grave issue of weight gain in toddlers. This essay will highlight what are the major reasons for obesity as well as the effects of the same on juveniles in the coming years.\n\nTo commence with, children are becoming obese due to two main reasons. Firstly, children are having an excessive intake of junk food. They usually prefer to eat burgers, pastries and pasta instead of having healthy homemade food. Like, families can be seen going to restaurants on the weekends, where they eat lots of calories leading to weight gain. Secondly, having a sedentary lifestyle is causing weight gain in children. To explain , children prefer to play indoor games these days, which don't involve physical activity leading to obesity. For instance, a survey conducted in the USA (United States of America) revealed that 80 per cent of children choose to remain at home watching television and doing indoor activities which are making them obese. Thus, a lazy lifestyle and junk food are making juveniles obese.\n\nWeight gain among children can lead to severe health issues in the future. People at a very young age will be suffering from heart disease. Due  to high levels of cholesterol in the blood vessels, juveniles will face heart failure. Furthermore, diabetes will become very common among juveniles in the coming time. To explain , due to obesity, juveniles will be having high levels of insulin in their body which will cause diabetes to them. For example, research in the northern part of India has shown that 60 per cent of obese people are suffering from diabetes and heart diseases. Therefore it can be said that obesity can lead to dangerous diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, this essay highlighted the causes of obesity among children are  junk food and a sedentary lifestyle.

What are the reasons What can employers do to make their life easier?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent times, many individuals have to work for longer hours, and they feel more stressed than previous generations. There are several reasons why many people in these days work for long hours including, increase the demand of work, availability  of technology, however, there are some measures can taken by employers to adressing this issue namely, reduce the number of work hours, employers  should not contact with their employees out of official time of work. \n\nOn the one hand, the primary reason why people work for long hours nowadays is increase the demand at work. To illustrate, the companies force their employees to work for long hours in order to increase the producitivity among their employees. This is because the job market in these days become more competitive and every company compete to provide a better services for their expect customers. Availability  of technology is another reason why people work for long hours in these days. The due to the fact that employers can contact with their workers via technology namely, computer, smartphone , which this can put a lot of pressure in workers. For example, some employers contact via technology with their workers during late time or their family time. \n\nOn the other hand, there are some measures can taken by the employers to mitigate this issue. The first effective solution, the employers could introduce policy  in order to  minimize  work hours. For instance, in Saudi Arabia the maximum working hours for all employees is 48 hours.  The employers  should not contact with their employees out of official time of work, which this can help employees to stay away for their jobs.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some argue that the most important aim of science should be to improve people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed that the most crucial goal of science should be making people's lives better. Although some people disagree with this idea, I totally think this should be the first priority of science.\n\nThe first reason why improving humans'lives is too prominent is that it will lead to a higher level of wellbeing. When people have a better quality of life, they are most likely to live happier and hopeful. For example, during pandemic the majority of scientists were trying to make a vaccine to eradicate the Corona virus and they eventually made a success. As a result, people now are capable of spending their time outside with ease.\n\nAdditionally, by emphasizing on improving people's quality of life as the most important aim of science, prevention can be the most significant result. In other words, when scientists are aware of their role in order to make citizens' lives better,they teach people how they can improve their physical and mental health. Thus, the level of illnesses as well as the cost of treatment would be reduced.\n\nSome argue that the most important responsible of science should be saving the environment. They refer to glabal warming phenomenon and it's catastrophic consequences in the future of humanity. However, I believe the performance of humans itself is the first reason why the globe is going to be warmer so through enhancing individuals' knowledge, many environmental issues would be declined.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the ultimate goal of science should be making mankind's lives better as it brings wellbeing and prevention of many mental and physical diseases.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that children at secondary school should be streamed, i.e. taught in classes according to ability, rather than being taught in mixed-ability classes. Do you think the advantages of streaming children outweigh disadvantages\"\nEssay:\n\"Teaching children in secondary grade is often divided into mixed-capability groups. It refers to the situation where students in a location do not belong to multiple intelligence classes. The classroom contains an exceptional one and  also those who face  difficulty in getting the knowledge. \n\nWhen all good learners are clustered and allocated to one section, these people would be having  high competition and consequently, they tend to develop  strong theoretical knowledge. Moreover, the teachers would be happy and do not require to put in greater effort. However, when a class contain lower-level admission, the pupils do not take motivation from others because all kids studying there lack in terms of their ability. In addition, the recruitment falling in this category would not be helpful to each other. Furthermore, the teacher would also feel difficulty in handling all  at  one time. They would not be able to access the issues because such classrooms require a lot of dedication. \n\nOn the contrary, there is another type that contains both intelligence and low ability. These educational spaces are considered ideal for both the children and the instructors. Expanding more, the admission who look sharper and more spontaneous would be  role models and  motivation for the rest. Other members will put effort into getting more better and outstanding results. However, sometimes it is also possible that the kids of these classes may feel down and jealous of high-score achievers. Therefore, it is the responsibility of their guide to maintain a balance between them. The teacher should evoke a sense of helping others to the brighter ones. I think a class that contains different ability students would be the best to improve the education system and the learning essence of the kids.\n\nTo sum up,  learning institutions should plan mixed-ability programs. This would be beneficial for building the lower students' abilities and it would also be a great effort to boost the best ones with other habits such as providing help to others.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCach danh gia Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n- Tra loi dung cau hoi de bai: Bai viet cua ban da tra loi phan lon cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den uu va nhuoc diem cua viec xep lop hoc theo nang luc o truong trung hoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that children at secondary school should be streamed, i.e. taught in classes according to ability, rather than being taught in mixed-ability classes. \n\nDo you think the advantages of streaming children outweigh disadvantages\"\nEssay:\n\"Teaching children at secondary grade is often divided into mixed ability groups. It refers to the situation where students in a class do not belong to multiple intelligence classes. They classroom contains an exceptional ones and the also those who faces the difficulty in getting the knowledge. \n\nWhen all good learners are clustered and allocated a one section, these people would be having a high competition and consequently, they tend to develop a strong theoratical knowledge. Moreover, the teachers would be happy and do not require to put greater effort. However, when a class contain lower level students, the pupils do not take motivation from others because all kids studying there lack in terms of their ability. In addition, the students falling in this category would not be helpful to each other. Furthermore, the teacher would also feel difficulty in handling all such students at the one time. They would not be able to access the issues of all students because such classrooms require a lot of dedication. \n\nOn contrary, there is another class that contains both the intelligent and the low ability students. These educational spaces are considered ideal for both the children and the instructors. Expanding more, the students who look more sharp and spontaneous would be a role model and a motivation for the rest of class. Other members will put effort in getting more better and outstanding results. However, sometimes it is also possible that the kids of these classes may feel down and jealous from high score achievers. Therefore, it is the responsibility of their guide to maintain a balance between them. The teacher should evoke a sense of helping others to the brighter ones. I think the class that contain different ability students would be the best to improve the education system and the learning essence of the kids.\n\nTo sum up, the learning institutions should plan a mixed-ability class programs. This would be beneficial for building the lower students ability and it would also be a great effort to boost the best ones with other habbits such as providing help to others.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response trong bai viet cua ban la kha tot.

This essay totally disagrees with that statement, I believe that it's not an obligation for hobbies to be difficult .......to be fun.\n\nFirst of all, when picking a leisure activity, individuals tend to choose something enjoyable, a pastime activity that helps them relax and decompress from a whole week of pressure and work; therefore, the level of difficulty is the last aspect that they base their choice on. Moreover, it has been proven in many studies and documentaries that most people enjoy the kind of hobbies that are simple and take an important amount of time to accomplish; hence, they get to spend most of their free time doing that, for instance, finishing missions of a video game or drawing a painting of a beautiful lake. \n\nSecondly, humans have a tendency to practice and enjoy collective activities in which every single one of them has a specific task to accomplish so the whole team wins; thus, it would be illogical for this particular game to be difficult. Furthermore, a lot of adults don't prefer hard activities for the simple reason that it requires them to use their muscles or their brain and to think hard to solve complex equations and missions because it makes them feel like they're at work. As a result, they tend to pick simple pastime activities.\n\nTo conclude, for the reasons mentioned above, my point of view is that hobbies don't have to be sophisticated to be enjoyable.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nVe Task Response, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach xac dinh quan diem cua ban (\"This essay totally disagrees with that statement\") va dieu nay da duoc phat trien trong toan bai viet cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It will be better for society and individuals if driverless cars are widely used.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is said it will be best for community and people if self-driving vehicles are widely utilized. I totally agree with this statement because driverless cars can have a positive impacts on both individuals and society.\n\nTo begin with, there are several reasons why I believe that cars powered by artificial  intelligence can be beneficial for people and community. Regarding individuals, self-driving cars can create more time for people. This is because people could use commuting time from home to work or school in valuable things namely, sleep, relax, and finsh their work or study responsibilities. Therefore, make people live more comfortable. Furthermore, the vehicles powered by artificial  intelligence require less maintenance .This is due to the fact that self-driving vehicles often made from high quality materials compared to traditional cars. Consequently, people can avoid high cost of maintenance and they can save a considerable amount of money. \n\nWhen it comes to society, the driverless cars can contribute alleviate traffic congestion. To illustrate, the traffic jams often result of bad drivers habits such as, sudden stop, sudden  turn right or  left , which means driverless cars can eliminate this bad habits of humans. Moreover, the driverless vehicles will assist to reduce the amont of Co2 footprint from cars. This is because cars powered by artificial  intelligence can use the fuel in efficient way. As a result, self-driving vehicles will contribute to mitigate climate change and global warming reuslt of minimize the amount of Co2 emissions on the atmosphere. \n\nTo sum up, I strongly believe that self-driving cars can have a positive impacts on both people and community, because it will make the life of individuals more convenient and eonomical. Additionally ,self-driving cars advantageuos for scoiety because it will easy traffic jams as well as it environmentally-friendly.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach dung dan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people blame the government for the increase in childhood obesity while others think it is the parents’ fault. Discuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"There has been an evident increase in childhood obesity in the past few decades. Some individuals believe this is completely in the governments hands, while others blame the parents. My view is that every parent is fully responsible for their child, whether it be their health, manners, or personality. The following paragraphs will explore both sides of the argument and why I disagree with immediately pointing fingers at the government in this case.\n\nAlthough it all comes down to the parents of the child at the end, governments possess the authority to get rid of the child obesity issue. A great first step could be reducing the insurmountable prices of healthy foods. Subsequently, parents with less financial stability would be able to afford nutritious food for their children. Likewise, schools encouraging young pupils to adopt a healthy lifestyle would help immensely. The FDA laws that companies abide by should grow stricter, thus forcing companies to sell nothing but nutritious products.\n\nConversely, I insist that parents have the ultimate influence on their family. After all, an apple never falls far from the tree. Almost everything regarding a child’s mental or physical health is inextricably linked to the birth giver. All children should be encouraged to take up sports, no matter what the sport is. In addition to that, meals prepared for them must include all that is required by their growing bodies, all the while being delicious and appetizing. Fast food will always exist, as it will forever be consumed. Nonetheless, a young one can be taught not to consume fast food regularly due to the harm it causes his/her health.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the government has a responsibility to create the best possible environment for a family to have good nutrition. This is achievable by many methods, mainly making it possible for all people to afford the ingredients in a balanced diet. However, I believe the parents will always have the greatest authority, as they are closest to their young ones.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCau tra loi cua ban da dung nhu yeu cau de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries around the world, rural people are moving to cities, so the population in the countryside is decreasing. Do you think this is a positive or a negative deveolpment?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that nowadays there is a direction of people changing their residences from the countryside to urban areas. While this treand that has been noticed in some countries worldwide, I believe that such behaviour negatively imapacts these countries on a variety of levels.\n\nThe growing number of people living in the cities has had many effects on people's lives. It has been a major challenge to countries' governments to accomodate for the highest ever number of people living in cities inspite of the improvements done in public services sectures, such as building new schools , hospitals and residential areas.\n\nMoreover, the increasing number of cars would really paly a role in worsening the pollution in cities. For instance, in Cairo, a study was done a study was done to show the effect of the immigration of 3 million households from rural areas to Cairo. Shockingly, this study revealed that there was a significant rise in pollution levels 3 months after the studied movement happened. Similar studies have been done around the world and have all highlighted the possible consequences of the newley noticed trend. \n\nI believe that people moving to urban areas from the coutryside have a negative effect on the former too. Firstly, people who live in rural areas usually work in farms growing crops and breeding many animals which provide  such as cows and chickens. Loss of such a vital sector of the work force will create shortages of important food items and the countries' government would have to import these produces to fill the gap between production and consumption, a step that will negatively impact their economies. Secondly, city life is hectic and very busy while village life is more peaceful and calm, therefore, people moving to cities will notice a major change in their lifestyle. Unfortunately, this change is not for the bettter, as it usually accomanied by increased level of stress and anxiety among those who have moved.\n\nIn conclusion, i believe that people immigrating to cities have many drawbacks and an action need to be planned to decrease to ultimitly decrease and control this trend.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, Task Response kha day du va ban da dap ung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Increased juvenile crime is attributed to violence in media. To what extend do you agree? What are the solutions?\"\nEssay:\n\"With increased access to all kinds of media, teenagers are really getting aggressive and violent with the passage of time. Though it can be partially attributed to the hormonal imbalance that is specific for this age, it is mainly because of the increased inclination of the media towards aggression and violence. I highly agree with the opinion that the media is responsible for this current issue. \n\nFirst of all, after the 9/11 incident, people were really into watching the news related to terrorism. So, the producers used that notion and start making movies and games that were based on this strategy. With such an influx of the same kind of programmes every now and then, adolescents usually adapt to them more easily. For instance, a recent study in China shows that there is a 20% increase in  juvenile detention in the last 10 years and the major reason for it is  their increased involvement in unlawful activities.  So, the government should impose a ban on telecasting of such dramas and movies and should impose a high charge for creating them.\n\nFurthermore, kids are usually very interested in playing video games and there are a lot of games based on the war and killings of people. These games should be banned as soon as possible by all means. There should be immediate action against them by the authorities. Parents should keep a close eye on their children and should activate the automated filters, both on TV and gadgets for the safety purpose.  Along with that, teenagers should be provided with enough opportunities to relax and enjoy themselves so that they start focusing on more positive things. The government should open more parks and should make arrangements for local sports competitions. Meanwhile, parents should enrol them on gyms, swimming classes and computer programming courses. \n\nTo sum up, utilising their energy in positive perspectives will help them to become better and responsible citizens in the future. Teaching them about the hazards is important but providing them with better alternatives is equally important.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va gioi thieu quan diem ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Car ownership has increased so rapidly over the past thirty years that in many cities around the world there are constant traffic jams.\n\nHow true do you think this statement is?\n\nWhat measures can governments take to discourage people from owning cars?\"\nEssay:\n\"Presently, the possession of vehicles has not become limited to affluent individuals due to modern technology which facilitates production at a lower cost. Although many economists laud this, environmentalists hold a diverse perspective. However, I am of the stance that owning motorcars has a malignant effect on the environment, state involvement can be the panacea for this. In the following lines, the previously-mentioned points will be thoroughly elaborated.\n\nTo embark on, recent technological development has led to the reduction of costs and the increase in productivity. In other words, when international organisations utilise their financial capabilities to purchase fully automated production lines, they boost their rate of production and decrease their expenditures. For example, Toyota, a renowned Japanese brand, is well-known for its exploitation of its expertise to produce cars with satisfactory quality and a relatively lower price. Hence, what can be deduced is that new technology is the chief rationale behind producing cars at an industrial scale and making them affordable to the populace.\n\nNevertheless, there are a number of remedies for this. If governments launch awareness campaigns to highlight the dangers of exhaust fumes and introduce profound communal transportation networks, the public will place their reliance on trains and buses because they are environmentally-friendly. For instance, despite the high-income of German citizens, many of them prefer using public transportation systems to taking their private vehicles to less air pollution. Thus, what can be inferred is that legislators should alter the behaviour of their citizenry by introducing other alternatives.\n\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the aforementioned points, it can be reiterated that the abundance of vehicles at a lower price is the predominant factor that encourages ordinary individuals to own cars. In my view, the interference of politicians is of utmost importance to mitigate the impact of this malicious trend.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung mot phan yeu cau cua de bai bang cach de cap den su tang nhanh so huu o to trong 30 nam qua va tinh trang ket xe thuong xuyen o nhieu thanh pho tren the gioi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many governments think that economic Progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other type of progress is equally important for their country.\n\n Discuss both these views and Give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Economic growth demonstrates the advancement of any country. Hence, numerous nations believe that a progressive economy is a fundamental component; however, on the flip side, certain social bubbles of society maintain that there are other kinds of developments which are as significant as economic progress.  I agree with this notion and am going to discuss both aspects.\n\nIt is true that a strong economy means rich and wealthy nations. In addition, the population is affluent and even lower-income communities have modest incomes and resources. The government has the services and assets to aid citizens in every possible way. For example, the public has reasonable job opportunities and salary rates,  health-related assistance and other forms of help and services.  \n\nOn the other hand, there are other factors a democracy needs in order to be rich, strong and powerful. Free education leads to an increase in literacy rate and there will be  more research, discoveries, and inventions in every realm of life. Moreover, there will be awareness among the masses about environmental issues and other social and global matters. Nowadays, our world has turned into a small global village where anyone can find an enormous amount of knowledge and information. A well-educated individual knows which online information is correct and needs to follow  and which needs to ignore. Education brings this awareness and sense of perception. Thus, an increase in literacy levels will automatically raise the growth of any state. \n\nIn conclusion, undoubtedly, economic and other kinds of developments play an important role in any agrarian’s growth and development.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries there are more young people choosing to enrol in work-based training instead of attending university.\n\nDo the advantages of this situation outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"A recent survey has indicated that in some countries the youth is more inclined towards industrial training rather than learning theoretical knowledge from the universities. This situation is like a coin with both aspects of pros and cons, but this essay will state the advantages of this drastic shift over-rides the disadvantages. \n\nTo commence, I would spare some light on the benefits of choosing work-based training. Firstly, nowadays employers are looking for some with a few years of industrial experience even for the entry-level position available in the corporate sector. Followed by the unchanged teaching methodology of the graduate curriculum making it more difficult for new graduates to secure a job and kick-start their career. While industrial training program is much more inclined towards the job role and its responsibility, hence allowing the minors to support their families after the completion of the program. Lastly, getting an education from a reputed college required a hefty amount of funds and most time this money is borrowed by the banks creating a stressful environment for the youth. \n\nHowever, there are even a few disadvantages to opting for these corporate programs. To initiate, the student enrolled in the program is stuck with only one career option taking away the thrill of learning something and exploring their potential. For instance, a study revealed that people who are enrolled in this industrial education often lack a wide range of knowledge reducing their chance of growing in future. But has even proven that these individuals are masters of their working stream making them unbeatable.\n\n In conclusion, the corporate sector training program can outweigh the university education if the teaching pattern is not upgraded and students are offered hybrid courses, that are a mix of industrial experience and a variety of subjects to choose from.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va chi ra rang loi ich cua viec tre em chon hoc nghe vuot troi hon nhuoc diem.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some think that the government should support retired people financially while others believe they should  take care of themselves. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In modern society, some people believe that the government should financially support the retired, ageing population while others think they should be able to be financially independent. I believe that the government should definitely support retired workers, especially the ones who have had a larger impact on the country’s well-being.\n\nThere is no denying that most people have a rough idea on when they would like to retire so planning in advance and having the ability to save money for their future is a big reason why the government shouldn’t pay. Therefore, it would make sense for the government to refuse financial support in this case. However, many jobs on minimum wage, especially the one’s directly involved with the government, do not make enough money to save for retirement. As a result, they would need extra support financially.\n\nNow to why the government should pay, there are multiple reasons. One of them being that many individuals pay taxes and have jobs that they can only sustain during their younger years. For example, soldiers working in the army retire younger and find themselves jobless after retirement. Not to mention how much they sacrifice for their country, only to be left with nothing as soon as they finish their service. As far as taxes are concerned, most of the money that the public spend, many of them never see the impact it has on the country. \n\nIn conclusion, the government should aim to implement schemes that give back to some of the most valuable members of our society. Without them, the country would struggle to function effectively. To give them nothing in return is a disgrace to the government.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la danh gia chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, there is an increasing trend of travelling across countries due to the season and  vacations. People tend to plan and go to various countries such as Switzerland, China, the USA, and Canada to explore more about the Western side.  While travelling in different countries, travellers want to explore  different paths. \n\nWhen  somebody travels as a tourist to some province for several weeks or months, his aim is to spend and enjoy the duration. But, some of them believe that there is a lot more than enjoyment. Moreover,  it is considered as utmost importance to learn the certain aspects of the country such as their religion, social values, weather hardships, business etc. \n\nI totally agree with the fact that  time is needed for discovering more and more arenas, a few days are not enough. Additionally, living in a hotel as a tourist won't lead to circumstances in which a human learns about the country. Moreover, during the season of tourism, the suites often overcharge as a result, they don't get the opportunity to move through all areas due to few resources. Furthermore, if a person has a goal of identifying and understanding the country in depth, he has to live there for  more time. Only then, there is a possibility of getting more specific and accurate knowledge. \n\nIn addition, each region of the globe has some speciality. Let's look at some of the examples of products available in Pakistan such as the food of Karachi, clothes available in Hunza, games played in the country, and tourist spots including Murree and Swat. To gain information about every aspect the character attains a chance of living for a reasonable era. \n\nTo sum up,  tourism is encouraged all around the world, not only, for the reason of improving the economy of a country but it provides a way to get glimpses of a homey.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"“ Many people think that men should go out to work while women’s place is in the home. To what extent do you agree or disagree?”\"\nEssay:\n\"It is often argued that men should be the breadwinner who should go out to work and earn money for all the incomes of the families and women should stay home and look after the whole family. However, I fundamentally disagree with the given notion.\n\n To begin with, before the second world war, the labour force was dominated by  males. Female workers could find  very little area in the job market to work but during and after the second world war producers needed a massive amount of Human Resources to keep their businesses running. Because   menfolk were serving in the military services. They started to hire female workers especially, in the USA. This was the first time when the female workers had shown they can do the same job.\n\nMoreover, over a few decades, females have become more qualified and they started to penetrate higher positions . Some people thought that  women have more physical weakness than  men and that prevented them to do jobs which require physical endurance. Although, that opinion is old-fashioned and completely wrong. Work like driving,loading and unloading of goods was only meant to be done by gentlemen but now ladies also can do these jobs effortlessly and effectively. Similarly , wrestling was unlikely to do by females before but no wonder women have made themselves capable enough to fit in that criteria.\n\nIn  conclusion, In today's world where gender role is becoming an important aspect of everybody's life.it is true that both are equally capable of doing things.Therefore, giving them equal opportunity can make them competent individuals in the workforce.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi Task Response trong bai viet cua ban da dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that it is best to save money, for example in a bank or savings scheme. Other people feel that money should be spent whenever it is available. Discuss these views and reach an opinion on this debate. \n\nGive reasons for your answer, and support your essay with ideas and examples from your own experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Saving money is one of the best ways to manage salary for some society, even though others think that we should spend all cash that we have. These communities have their own perspectives and we will discuss them in this essay.\n\nFirstly, it is certainly true that saving cash is good for future plans. These range from budgeting to travel, to pension costs and sudden accidents. For example, we have a car accident on the way to the office that needs cash to recover both the car and ourselves. If we don't have wealth in our bank account, it is too hard to solve this problem because we need to go to the bank and submit for a loan that there is a possibility of not being approved. Secondly, savings also can be an investment to make someone become more rich and have financial freedom. There are many types of investment that are offered today by banks or securities from low to high returns. \n\nIn comparison, many societies think that we only live once and there is no guarantee that we still live tomorrow. For this reason, spending all of our wealth is the best way to enjoy this life because we can have whatever we want and try anything before we die. If we just save our salary and suddenly die, our saving fund will be caused new problems for our families member because they will fight to get that property. Afterwards, saving wealth in a bank account has a possibility of loss. There are many cases all around the world in that depositors lost their checks because the bank fool them.\n\nTo sum up, I strongly believe that a savings check is the best choice for some reasons, like long-time plans or problem anticipation. Instead spend all of our funds because afraid to save them in a bank account, we should find credible authorities to help manage our fees.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ve hai quan diem khac nhau ve viec tiet kiem tien va tieu tien.

This essay will discuss the benefits for a business of having a uniform and their advantages for their staff.\n\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why the business having a uniform is beneficial. A common reason is that uniforms make it easier for businesses to manage their employees. For instance, when their staff wear a uniform, the uniform helps identify members in a group or helps discern differences with other businesses and is easy to employee control. Another cause can be that the uniform shows cultural identity business and show solidarity of collective in business. In fact, uniform shows the solidarity of the collective and uniforms are a combination to turn differences into uniformity.\n\nOn the other hand, a uniform has numerous benefits for the staff. One of the main advantages of a uniform for employees is to bring a sense of equality and fairness among employees. Uniformsuniforms help everyone to become the same and no differences between rich and poor as well as class in society. Since then, the treatment between employees is the same. Another benefit is that uniforms help people save time and money choosing outfits for work. In fact, employees will not lose time to choose things and do not lose money to buy things for work.\n\nIn conclusion, uniforms help build corporate style and culture.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"The exaggerated role of economic growth at the expense of other factors is singled out as a pressing issue preoccupied many governments. It is irrefutable that financial status can drive an entire country's situation; however, I oppose this conservative capitalist viewpoint.\n\nAdvocates cited, therefore, earning a lucrative income is an unattainable goal without a thriving economy. Not only can better living standards for the citizens ensue as a byproduct of stable financial status, but it also triggers the leap of instrumental fields. Since the impetus for radical changes may derive from the domestic budget, ensuring a country’s wealth will have far-fetching implications. For instance, developing nations can actively fortify themselves against foreseeable recession in many fields thanks to the stronghold of economic themes.\n\nHowever, it is commonly asserted that a multipronged strategy, aimed at spurring equal growth, is of paramount importance. Had it not been for the disproportion in attention, governments would have been proactive to conduct either educational or environmental pre-emptive measures to handle dormant issues. The stamina of a nation can abate crises by instigating reform programs in both fiscal policies or another one, the economy will not be overburdened. For example, countries that highlight all-round development are inclined to overrun their counterparts in the long run.\n\nJuxtaposing economic priority and full-scale allocation, the shortcomings of the former policies will overshadow its benefits. Emphasizing the economy can jeopardize the domestic balance, leaving alone the fact that stagnation can recur. \n\nIn conclusion, reflecting economic progress’s importance in maintaining life quality within a country, its drawbacks will not be worth the sacrifice.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the interest of global prosperity, developed countries urge to assist economic aid for underdeveloped nations as a poverty salvage. It is considered that they ought to support alternative assistance in place of financial help. Here, I partially agree with this viewpoint.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that money is a crucial means for every nations to operate their society, government. Economic growth increase state capacity and provide the public goods and services that their citizens need, such as health care, education, social security. Vietnam, in a hardship situation after stated the triumph declaration of victory in 1975, had been struggle to regenerate the country. As a result of ceaseless efforts of enrichment accompanied with generous support of international friends, Vietnam nowadays has made a incredible development, as they are now a developing country with high life quality and potential emerging market for international investment.\n\nHowever, not all of the poor countries with money assistance can utilise their budget. For instance, numerous African countries live in extreme poverty such as Chad, Congo, Nigeria,...can't get through tough circumstance although worldwide economic assistance was called to aid them. This is because these supporting means was just for a temporary period which is not stable for the national long-term growth. Thus, alternative sources with multitude of feasibility and sustainability is the investment and aid from education to health care system or advancing human's right. Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg, these generous countries are on there way of making other types of help to impact the world positively.\n\nIn conclusion, I think aiding budget for countries facing economical difficult is greatly important, but to long-lasting the advantages and stably develop for the sake of its future, affluent countries should concentrate on the education, health care and people life's quality.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tham gia vao cuoc tranh luan ve viec cac nuoc phat trien nen cung cap cac loai tro giup khac thay vi vien tro tai chinh cho cac nuoc ngheo.

I totally agree with this statement because moving large industries and factories and their employees to the countryside areas can contribute to the reduce the inhabitants in large cities in order to mitigate traffic congestion and also provide create enough spaces for build a new houses . \n\nTo begin with, there are several reasons why I believe that encourage large industries and factories and their employees to moving  to  rural areas assist to addressing  Traffic congestion and housing problems.  Regarding traffic  jams, motivate large industries and factories moving to country to rural areas can contribute to reduce the population in large urban areas. This is because the large industries and factories have a huge number of employees, which means this trend can reduce the number of vehicles  used by large industries and factories and their workers . Therefore, moving large industries and factories and their employees will help to alleviate the traffic congestion. \n\nIn terms of housing, if the government incentivize large industries and factories and their employees to moving the rural areas this will contribute to tackle housing problems. This is because the government can use the areas of industries and factories in order to construct a new accommodations for local people, which trend can create enough spaces for homes construction.  Furthermore, this trend can make the price of housing affordable for people, because minimize  the population on large cities means more housing available for people in large cities with competitive prices. \n\nTo sum up, I strongly believe that motivate large industries and factories and their employees to moving  to countryside areas will contribute to solve the issues related of housing and traffic jams, because it decrease  the inhabitants in large urban areas as well as creare more spaces for bulidng homes in large cities.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nNhan xet chi tiet ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi duoc de ra.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Completing university education is thought by some to be the best way to get a good job. On the other hand, other people think that getting experience and developing soft skills is more important.\n\nDiscuss both sides and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is considered by some that being a university graduate is the key to securing a good job, while there are others who think that it is better to have experience and soft skills. In my opinion, I believe that having a university education is essential for academic jobs, while soft skills and experience are more useful in business.\n\nOn the one hand, many think it is easier for most people to find a good job if they are university graduates with a good degree. In other words, having tertiary education puts people one step ahead of others who do not and this can be the deciding factor in getting a good job. The competition to get into universities and the increasing number of graduates show just how significant this level of education is for people's future work opportunities.\n\nOn the other hand, having work experience and soft skills, such as leadership skills and other interpersonal skills, can also throw the balance in favour of the applicant, according to some. For many positions there are an overwhelming number of applicants and, therefore, it is often thought that having relevant experience in that line of work or having acquired useful soft skills that can be valuable to a company, can put one ahead of the game when applying for a position.\n\nFinally, in my opinion, whether needing a high level of education or skills and experience, depends on the position being applied for. Take for example law, medicine or teaching, it is impossible to be considered for a position without the required educational background. In contrast, in business, it would be more important for a candidate to have soft skills and experience in that line of business so they can step into a position without further training and be of immediate benefit to the company.\n\nIn conclusion, getting a good job requires a relevant background either in experience or education depending on the type of work and field. People should make sure they attain the necessary skills or degrees before applying for a job in order to be sure of success.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai mat cua van de va dua ra y kien ca nhan cua minh.

There are various origins for providing  knowledge and  advice to the community. These include newspapers,  television,  radio, the social media applications named Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc, There are different schools of thought available for opting for  a medium to attain the announcement to each individual. \n\nFor some populations,  magazines are a valid source. The style of the newspaper captures all the domains which need to be highlighted ,for example,  domestic announcements, and  international news. Moreover, there is a section present for the fashion industry. Also, the part is reserved for kids to read the stories. Additionally, they think the intelligence attained from the printed  medium is more valuable and trustworthy. Moreover, these people do not trust  the other sources due to the issue that they believe hardcopy always contains a verified report. Furthermore, the individual who reads the newspaper also tends to increase their vocabulary and is ,therefore, more active and confident, and responsive to communication. \n\nIn contrast, to the rest of the individuals, the remaining authority could be a better and more efficient way of learning what is happening around us. They feel more updated and this group doesn't have to wait for the upcoming day instead they receive  real-time facts. On the contrary, might not be able to get honest updates because over the internet every piece of information could not be verified in real-time. \n\nTo sum up, the broadcast plays an important role in understanding and gaining information about the recent environmental and  social issues of their surroundings and the world.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people argue that it is best to accept a bad situation, such as an unsatisfactory job or shortage of money. Others believe that it is better to try and improve such situations.\n\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Unfortunate events are inevitable. Each person may experience various kinds of difficulties in their life, and this leads to different responses. In this essay, I will elaborate on the extent to which I disagree or agree that people should accept the bad situation as it is and provide reasons for such arguments. \n\nTo begin with, some people believe accepting the faith or the result of unsatisfactory situations, such as an unsatisfying work environment or lack of money, helps them to overcome the situations. It has been believed that unfortunate events may teach them some lessons, for example, patience, and motivate them to be better and try different things with the prospect of different results. These kinds of people are not the kind of people who give up easily. Instead, they understand the mistake they made, found solutions, and project them to other opportunities. \n\nOn the other side, some people tend to not easily accept the situations and try to escalate the effort to maximize the circumstances and get the best outcomes. For example, Thomas Alfa Edison ultimately managed to invent the light bulb after more than 1000 times trying. If he had given up just after one or two first attempts, the world we live in today would not exist. From the example, we can learn that being persistent and resilient to be better at overcoming bad situations may lead us to greater success.\n\nTo sum up, each response has its own benefits. Nevertheless, whatever the outcomes are, the process of getting to one point is much more important as it teaches people with different skills and abilities.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem: chap nhan tinh hinh xau nhung co gang cai thien no hoac khong chap nhan va no luc de tan dung tinh huong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people buy their children a large number of toys to play with.what are the advantages and disadvantages of having large number of toys.\"\nEssay:\n\"Toys are essential tools that aid in a child's development in different aspects. A number of parents buy their children many toys to discover. In this essay, I will tackle the different pros and cons of this matter. \n\nTo begin with, there are a lot of material things  that are beneficial in a kid's journey. Musical instruments, rattles, stuffed toys, and bicycles are just some of the toys that can be found in the mall which are very attractive to the youngsters. As a mother, I am guilty of buying almost anything I think my son needs and also those he's been wanting to have. Because of that, I can observe that he has developed different skills such as learning how to ride the bike, or how he finds music interesting, and even playing pretend using dolls. \n\nOn the other hand, because he has a lot of toys to choose from, some toys are being neglected. A child can only focus on what he finds enjoyable at the moment and forgets to play with the others. As a result, it will just be placed in the stock room and sometimes be forgotten. As an example, my husband and I bought our offspring a  basketball ring because he was so  into basketball at that time, but eventually got tired of it and puzzles that shifted his attention. \n\nTo end, whilst toys are essential things needed for a child's development, the number should also be kept to a minimum. Aside from it can save space in your place, you can also prevent from spending too much and you can be assured that they are going to play with it.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung dung va day du yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is becoming increasingly popular to have a year off between finishing school and going to university.What are its advantages and disadvantages.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, having a period off during the time before joining a university is prevalent.This essay will \n\nexamine the advantages and disadvantages of  providing admission with  a moment crack after finishing school \n\nand provide a logical conclusion.\n\nThe two main advantages of taking an age gap are improved academic performance and personal growth.Firstly, during a year gap, admission  can get rid of  academic rigour. This means that, they \n\nget plenty of time to involve themselves  in different  activities in which they are interested , and  return to their studies with renewed energy and focus. Secondly, a age gap  enhances the personal growth of the admission. For instance, student's participation in numerous field help build confidence to cope with uncertainties, make them experienced in various activities, and their mistakes and eventually prepares them for  higher studies.\n\nHowever, a year break has also some  major disadvantages such as the increased risk of involvement in illegal activities and chances of becoming demotivated.When recruitment does not find appropriate works they  may  involve in selling drugs, trafficking, committing crimes and so on .For example, not all students are  blessed with a strong financial background and can afford travel expenses, internships, or other opportunities, which can lead them to engage in criminal action.What’s more, long holidays can make pupils  lazy and  tired.For instance, they lack a sense of maturity and are unable to obtain applicable jobs, face breakups with their partners, family pressure and other hindrances that hinders personal growth.\n\nTo conclude,  a year off has certain negative effects like the potential for unlawful actions and losing enthusiasm. In spite of that, it has an extremely positive influence on learners' educational achievement and self-actualization.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ve cac loi ich va nhuoc diem cua viec co mot nam nghi ngoi truoc khi di vao dai hoc.

Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. \n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Parents play an imperative role in the grooming and upbringing of their children,however,when it comes to deciding the best school for them which not only provides an ecstatic learning environment but also moulds their personality in accordance with the norms and values of the society,some opt for uni-sex institutes while other prefers co-learning facilities.Many individuals have a notion that sending kids to single-sex school have drawbacks which become obvious later in life and I wholly agree with this.This essay will discuss both the positives and the negatives of this crucial decision which parents take with uttermost care.\n\n          In this fast-paced world,it is mandatory for youngsters to cope with it so that they not only turn out to be shrewd but also competent.This is only possible if they are provided with the latest innovations and a challenging environment to grow.Hence,multi-sex institutes assist them to interact with not only children of diverse cultures but also of the opposite sex,contributing significantly to their cognitive learning.Moreover,they become habitual in studying and working in pairs and groups including both  boys and girls,subsequently,they feel optimistic and comfortable in adulthood.For example,an article revealed that students graduating from uni-sex colleges are nervous in the presence of female colleagues at the workplace,affecting their performance drastically.\n\n      Furthermore,there are a few obvious pitfalls of sending children to  single-sex institutes.Firstly,they lack the essential exposure required at a young age  to comprehend the needs and emotions of those of different gender.Secondly,it is important to stay not only calm but also relaxed in the company of others,however,they become agitated and confused with such exposure later on in life.Nevertheless,i surmise that the benefits of co-education are mammoth whereas the disadvantages are rather few only and vice versa\n\n     To conclude,this dissertation discussed the role of parents in selecting the school for their kids.Many people think that there are many downsides to sending them to the same gender schools like lack of confidence,peculiar behaviour when accompanied by different gender and inability to perform optimally at work.I completely agree with this notion.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la danh gia chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n- Bai viet cua ban da trinh bay y kien   ve viec gui tre di hoc truong don gioi va truong hoc chung gioi tinh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Whether or not someone achieves their aims is mostly by a question of luck. To what extent do you agree or not agree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent years, it has been a controversial and debatable topic if luck can be the only factor leading to success.From my perspective, achieving goals and dreams requires determent and hardworking, and it is not about good fortune.  In the following paragraphs, I will express my opinion and support it with valid reasons and examples, and reach a reasonable conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, converting a dream into reality may require many things. One main point is determent and passion. This involves the welling of trying over and over until the aim is secured. My culture has a famous kid's tale where an ant holding rice trying to reach its home over the hill. Whenever it reached almost the top, it trampled again and fell. This ant kept trying until it eventually and successfully reached the top of the hill.  This story can illustrate the importance of attempting and repeating the action until reaching the desired destination, as well as not being afraid of committing mistakes or failure. \n\nFurthermore, another key to success is planning. To clarify, people who arm their dreams and goals with methods and strategies are more able to achieve them as long as those goals are realistic. For instance, if a government would like to fight corruption, they need to enforce a law against it and apply strong penalties. Consequently, this will lead to hitting the goal, which is the increment in the level of honesty. \n\nTo sum up, people argue all the time that good fortune may or may not be behind their achievements. However, I strongly believe that hardworking, insisting, passion and planning are the most effective key factors that ease the way to greatness.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more people are moving away from an agricultural background to relocate to cities in order to look for work.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, an increasing number of farmers  leaving their agricultural work  and  migrating to urban areas for better job opportunities. This essay will discuss the main consequences of migrating to city areas  and propose some solutions of this problem.\n\nThe main consequences caused by farmers relocating in different city areas are a decrease in agricultural products and an  increased risk of over population.Farmers are the backbone of a country because they provide food to people.When individuals from agricultural backgrounds seek higher work prospects, they tend relocating to  places where they can meet their requirements.As a result, less production leads to a scarcity of food and hampers gross domestic product of a country. Additionally, dependency on other countries also increases. Moreover, as city areas are already crowded by large numbers of people, when farmers move to these places, it becomes overpopulated and unmanaged.For instance, in Kathmandu, a large proportion of people coming to settle every year  has deteriorated the quality of life in a city. Air pollution, noise pollution, and finding suitable jobs are the major rising challenge of downtown areas.\n\nIn my opinion, the best solution to these results is building schools, colleges, and hospitals in the countryside. Firstly, most  parents want their children to be educated, healthier and  have a bright future. When colleges and hospitals are built in such areas, obviously, the number of people moving to city areas will eventually decrease. Moreover, farmers should be provided subsidies and other facilities. If loans are provided by government to farmers, then they can enhance their performance and productivity. Insecticides, pesticides, manures, irrigation facilities, and other essential materials should be granted  to boost the agricultural sector. Thus, fulfilling the needs of farmers leads to the overall well-being of a country.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend of people moving to  downtown areas in search of career openings results in many consequences, including scarcity  of crops and an unmanaged population. The most effective solution is to furnish  health, higher education and most importantly, subsidies to local people by the authorities.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach thao luan ve cac hau qua chinh cua viec di cu den thanh pho va de xuat mot so giai phap.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that climate effects the person’s way of life while other believe that climate has greater impact on economy of a region. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"The humidity of the region impacts it in many ways. The climate faces several major issues such as snowfall, heavy rain, fog, and smog. The climate has been dominating the  nation in many ways. People believe there are two major ways in which the community can be affected. Firstly, the group belong to the thought of its impact on daily routine.  Secondly, it also leaves an impression on the economy. \n\nFor the first cluster of people, regular activities such as washing and drying  clothes may highly be suffered from the conditions with snow and heavy precipitation. Moreover, this could also create problems with the availability of food items. In addition,  individuals can also feel  difficulty in travelling from one place to another.  In addition,  traffic disturbance could also be noted as a result of the worst climatic situations. \n\nIn contrast, the second school of thought is associated with the effect of a poor atmosphere on the economy of the country. Furthermore, the seasonal outcome of Gross Domestic Product is mapped to the availability of the livestock, the products for import and exports, and the travel business may slow down for a limited time period. \n\nTo conclude, the major problem of climate change has seen a big impact on different avenues. Not only does it affects the living style but it could also be bad for the business and growth of the country.  Both the groups are valid to some extent, for the first ,group the living standards are more valuable than the sustainability of the region.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Most people agree that money cannot buy happiness. Why is happiness difficult to define? How can people achieve happiness?\"\nEssay:\n\"Whether money can buy happiness has been an ongoing debate for many years. Happiness is one of the most difficult emotions to define as there are multiple factors which determine one’s contentment in life. I will be proposing a few ideas on how one can achieve happiness.\n\nFirstly, we have to define what is happiness? For some it may be family, for others it is having abundant wealth. Therefore, the meaning of happiness is incredibly difficult to determine. Moreover, in recent studies, multiple factors have been used to attempt to define happiness. These include, living conditions, wealth, family, etc. For example, a poorer person in Africa may not have wealth, but have family which gives them enough happiness. This is why some of these studies are not reliable but may be able to give some indication of how happiness can be measured.\n\nThere are some ways people can be happier. The main way would be to prioritise what makes them happy. As discussed above, this can vary from person to person. Moreover, a big reason people are not happy in modern society is that their focus is always on what they don’t have as opposed to what they do have. Consequently, making them feel empty and dissatisfied with life. Therefore, being grateful is a key factor to achieve happiness and practicing being grateful can be quite simple. For example, every morning, people can write down three things they are grateful for before starting their day.\n\nIn conclusion, happiness is very personal and may have a different meaning to each person. Being able to identify what makes a person happy and focusing on that would be the way to achieve happiness. There are no set parameters so everyone’s journey is different.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCai ma ban can cai tien trong phan Task Response la viec trinh bay quan diem cua ban ngay tu dau bai viet.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that it is the responsiblity of individuals to take care of their own health and diet. Others, however, believe that gorvernments should make sure that their citizens have a healthy diet. Discuss both views, and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"With respect to the topic referring to who should shoulder the responsibility for citizens' health and diet, many contend that it is the government's task to maintain individuals' fitness, while others opine that it is something that residents should take into consideration.\n\n　　On one hand, the fitness level of citizens plays a significant role in the development of society, which means the government is regarded to emphasize that. It is alleged that the majority of illness, such as a huge proportion of gastric perforation and enterogastritis, is generally attributed to the unhealthy or unreasonable diet of inhabitants. Hence, encouraging individuals to form a reasonable and balanced diet habit serves as an effective and efficient way to diminish the rate of illness. In this case, the pressure of an overloaded medical system can be released to a great degree, which means the government can distribute more funds to other domains.\n\n　　 On the other hand, it is unpractical, unresponsible and unrealistic to transfer the responsibility that residents should take to the government. Individuals ought to take the initiative to attend to themselves. Unlike infants, most citizens are equipped with the ability to take care of themselves. It's nearly effortless for individuals to form a healthy diet spontaneously, while it is of great difficulty for the government to spur citizens into action. For instance, even if the authority enforces a related status, it cannot be implemented without the cooperation of individuals.\n\n　　In my opinion, while the authority should get involved in the forming of a diet, individuals are expected to shoulder the main responsibility. The government, possessing a wide range of functions, ought to invest the energy and capital into other fields such as military units and police force, rather than some domain that individuals should take over. Only by distributing duties scientifically and reasonably, can  society function well and march on.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va gioi thieu ca hai quan diem ve viec ai chiu trach nhiem cho suc khoe va che do an uong cua cong dan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"We should return to traditional and older values of respect for family and community. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is claimed that modern society should re-embrace the time-honored, traditional values of family and community that it has abandoned. In my point of view, it is true that more importance  should indeed be attached to the household and collectivism, but it seems unrealistic to apply those old values in contemporary society.  \n\nAdmittedly, more appreciation toward our family and community would help to strengthen family bonding and promote social cohesion. Individualism has eroded the younger generation, making them indifferent to what happens in their own communities or even in their own homes. Once old-fashioned concepts come back, people can be unconsciously influenced and thereby spend more time accompanying their family members and giving an ear to their elderly parents. In the meantime, more participation and support from neighbours would be seen in all kinds of communal activities. This progress, viewed in the long run, will necessarily bring a united and harmonious nation.\n\nHowever, when trying to arouse people’s awareness of respecting their family units or communities, the risk of hypercorrection should not be ignored. This is because, being well-educated and growing up in this enlightened society, people nowadays have stronger individual consciousness and refuse to have their lives arranged. Facing the huge generation gap, some people may have to sacrifice their personal choices and values and submit to the preference of their parents, if asked to “respect” the decision made by their family. Worse still, some minority groups, in order to be more socially accepted, are likely to weaken their identity and follow the modern social trend blindly, which will also pose a threat to our social diversity.\n\nIn conclusion, we are supposed to pay more attention to  traditional family values and the sense of community, but it does not mean that these old ideas should be fully accepted in this ever-evolving world.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach cho biet quan diem cua ban la can quan tam den gia tri gia dinh va cong dong, nhung khong hoan toan dong y voi viec ap dung nhung y tuong co xua trong xa hoi hien dai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it.\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In this cyber era, society tends to be more creative in terms of selling goods, which can be seen from a concrete example, advertisements. The commercial display has brought  massive success in convincing people to shop for items. On the other hand, because of its common use, some people argue that commercial broadcasts are no longer unique. However, I disagree that advertisements no longer attract people. In this following essay, I will elaborate on the extent to which I agree that advertisements still attract individuals to buy things and provide some examples. \n\nThe commercial publication has been used for many years in order to levitate the rate of sales, as it promotes and persuades people to buy items. There are many forms of advertisements, for example, billboards, flyers, or video motion on television or website. Marketing companies have their own unique ways to promote their sales, aiming their market target, and constructing their advertisement concept. Marketers use models, various colours and unique places to produce a certain characteristic of publicity. Because of this reason, I believe using advertisements as a way to boost sales is a creative idea. \n\nHowever, people may seem bored with two-dimensional space advertisements. Hence, these days, companies tend to use three-dimensional space commercial displays. This can be seen, for example, Maybelline a cosmetic companies, use fake lashes at the top of a bus and a train in London and complete with the brushes, to promote their mascara products. As a result, people are attracted to their promotion and the number of their mascara production increased. \n\nIn conclusion, advertisements have an effective way to escalate the sale rate. However, advertisers have to be more creative in terms of conceptualizing and producing unique and appealing advertisements.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem va dua ra y kien cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some cultures, children are often told that they can achieve anything if they try hard enough.\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of giving children this message?\"\nEssay:\n\"For a long time, society views hard work as a prime determination in achieving success.  In this following essay, I will discuss thoroughly the positive and negative impacts and provide some evidence of this behaviour towards children.\n\nFirst and foremost, promoting hard work can be advantageous for young people in some ways. Maximizing effort is essential to sharpening persistent and resilient skills. With these skills, children are able to adapt to difficult situations and find the solution to solve the issues that may occur. For instance, in order to achieve straight A’s, students must prioritize and be willing to commit to homework, long-hour mentoring sessions, and practice with various kinds of tests with different levels of difficulty. However, hard work must be done with consistency. Hence, by combining these two attitudes, children will perform much better and leading to higher chances of success.\n\nOn the other hand, hard work may bring an unpleasant impact on children. A long-haul discipline without any rest may cause burnout and disrupt the mental health condition. For example, if we force children to study without any rest or day off, success is not something that is close to achieving, instead they will get stressed which even leads to depression. To ease some pressures, it is important for children to have some personal traits, such as holidays or going out with friends. Furthermore, aside from taking some time off, setting goals and purposes may also help young people to map out their effort and know what to achieve. \n\nTo conclude, indeed hard work motivates children in achieving their goals and dreams. However, it is also important to note, a hard effort may bring pressure which leads to harmful impacts. Hence, setting clear goals and having some time off may balance the negative impact of hard work.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den loi va hai cua viec noi voi tre em rang ho co the dat duoc bat cu dieu gi neu co gang lam chu.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more people want to study at university, so competition of university places is increasing. Why do more people want to study at university? Is it positive or negative?\"\nEssay:\n\"Tertiary education is a valuable resource in many societies and the escalating number of applicants is strengthening its blessed status. In this essay, I will analyze the main reasons for this phenomenon and follow this discussion with critical comments on its influence on both individuals and the whole society.\n\nFor present-day youngsters, a certificate of bachelor's degree is more than a qualification . Instead, it is a guarantee of a handsome salary,a promising career and even a higher social class. Colleges prepare graduates in job-seeking, with specialized skills and a diploma of a certain major, enabling them to be employed by prestigious enterprises. Besides the direct and visible benefits brought by university education, years of campus life are believed as a great opportunity to expand one's social circle and become insightful. Brains gather together and exchange their ideas, rendering every participant open-minded and future-oriented. Therefore, Universities, which are generally described as Ivory Tower, successfully attract millions of talents and are also the original place of countless groundbreaking ideas.\n\nRegarding the impact of the increasing popularity of attending university, I have to admit the benefits are evident while the risk of mindlessly pursuing a place given by those academic organizations should never be overlooked. As is aforementioned, studying in a college, especially those national-class or world-class one, facilitates access to the success of alumni. More importantly, a country will necessarily benefit from a growing number of well-educated youngsters ,with  corresponding higher productivity and lower crime rate. However, for those who are academically disadvantaged , this trend will inevitably put them in a catch-22 . It can be observed that some of them are forced to further their study but not to  pursue their real passion. Worse still, unemployment is another painful consequence brought by \"college fever\" .It can be noticed that in many countries, the graduation season coincides with the unemployment season during the gradually losing competitiveness of university students. \n\nIn conclusion, it is understandable that applicants spare no effort to win a place in their dream school, yet the profound influence needs to be critically and carefully analyzed.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da cung cap cac nguyen nhan chinh khien so luong nguoi muon hoc tai dai hoc tang len va da tra loi dung cau hoi trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays young people are admiring media and sports stars, even though they do not set a good example. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays young generations are adoring media and sports stars, despite the fact that they do not display a good example. I believe this is a bad development because young people could follow the negative influence of some media and sports stars and it can affect their activities in school.\n\nTo begin with, media and sports stars tend to show inappropriate actions that can influence people to do the same thing as they did, especially since most of the people who were influenced by them are young people. In order to make their ratings high, some media broadcast hot gossip that could make people interested in it and most of them are related to underage content. For instance, TikTok display tiktokers that wore transparent clothes which are under age content and it reach 2 million viewers. As a result, kids will be curious and start to search for the same content which may lead to addiction to 18+ videos.\n\nFurthermore, some kids imitate the inappropriate habits and behaviour of their favourite athletes, and they depict actions that lead to a bad attitude in their school activities. For instance, young people are smoking in their school area because they thought that it is an awesome action to be shown and it will affect their studies and activities because they have addicted to smoking. As a result, schools will give heavy sanctions and worse they will drop out of school.\n\nIn conclusion, media and sports stars tend to give a bad influence on young generations. It will start with curiosity and end in the addiction to  underage content. Some young people may even imitate their bad actions such as smoking, and as a ,result the activities in school will be disturbed and worse school will drop out them.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai ro rang bang cach tao ra cac lap luan cho ca hai mat tich cuc va tieu cuc cua viec nguong mo cac ngoi sao truyen thong va the thao.

In my opinion, the merits of migrate of  people from their homwtown to other places outweigh the demerits because this development beneficial for personal and professional life of people. \n\nOn the other hand, the primary drawback of migrate people from the area where they were born and brought up  to other area is they can face culture shock .  This is because moving to a new zones means experience a new culture and custom, which means people  are moer vulnerable to  struggle in order to  adapt with this a new experience. Consequently,people will become under stress result of experience a new culture and maybe they get mental health issues namely, depression, anxiety.  \n\nOn the other hand, I would like to argue that the benefits of move people from the area where they were born and brought up significantly more than downsides. The first advantage, people will experience a new culture and custom, which means people will become more open mind to accept diversity cultural.  As a result, this development can contribute to spread the peace on the world  through unite people together.  A better job opportunity is another advantage for moving people away from their hometown to a new cities or town. For example, people who move from developing countries to industrialized countries are more likely to get a better jobs with good salaries, which means migration  improve the quality  of people live. \n\nTo sum up, In my perspective, although the moving people away from the area where they were born and brought up can bring downisdes namely, culture shock, I still believe the the upsides of this development outweigh the downsides, because is advantagous for personal as well as professional life of individuals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi yeu cau trong bai viet cua ban (Task Response):\n- Bai viet cua ban chinh xac tra loi cau hoi de bai.\n- Ban da phan tich ca uu va nhuoc diem cua viec di cu xa khoi noi sinh song ban dau.\n- Tuy nhien, y tuong cua ban can duoc mo rong va phat trien hon de lam cho bai viet tro nen sau sac hon va thuyet phuc hon.\n\nCach cai thien:\n- Hay cung cap them thong tin va vi du cu the de minh chung cho y kien cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people.\n\nWhy might this be the case?\n\nDo you think this is a positive or negative situation?\"\nEssay:\n\"Today in some countries it is very essential for people to have their own house rather than living in a rented apartments. There can be different reasons why people prefer it but personally, I do believe that it is better for people.\n\nSupporters of this idea usually say that every person should have guaranteed roof over a head, a home, which will always welcome its master and will not requite any payments for it. They are convinced that it is extremely important to own a house by their middle ages, also. It is impossible to live in a renting house at the ages of 70-80, they believe. For example, people especially 40-50 aged ones, in Kazakhstan support this point of view because it is a convention in their culture. Centuries ago youngsters of Kazakh Khanate had had aim of constructing their own house, which is named as a “Yurt” for their future families. And today this tradition is still exists, with houses, changed only\n\nAs a citizen of country where it is a convention to buy own houses, I agree that it is a positive development. Firstly , everyone has to think about his/her future. Renters might be evicted from house at any time, so they will not have a place to go. Therefore it is not really safe to rent accommodations. Furthermore, it is cheaper to live in house which owns to a person rather than pay monthly to someone who cannot even guarantee safety. Moreover, youngsters of these countries will be more independent if they will have a name to buy own house. They will be responsible for their house and everything that it requires, such as paying taxes, for instance. \n\nIn conclusion, different countries may have different occasions, undiscussed question, like in Kazakhstan’s example.

Personally, I would share this point of view\n\nIn today’s digital ages, people can find online, whatever they want. Online shops, news, games, videos are becoming more common in modern society, so that even elderly people use them. Everyone, now,has devices , which are extremely convenient for reading both books and news. So, only old-fashioned people, today, buy newspapers or paper books. Also, according to recent statistics, 70% of book lovers use e-books and read via them. This shows that in the near future, it is possible that e-books will completely replace paper books. Moreover, as far newspapers and books are now becoming less popular among people, it will not be a profitable business to sell them. \n\nPeople give their preference to digital texts for different reasons. Firstly, they do not require any payments, and this aspect is very attractive to readers. Secondly, there is no need to go somewhere, to leave home and pay for vehicle. Therefore, it is again, more profitable for reader as she/he does not spend money to get to a particular shop.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that all children should learn second language from the time they start school, while others believe that it is better to wait until a child is at secondary school. Discuss both views and give Your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Owing to the irreversible trend of globalization, people are motivated to learn foreign languages for overseas travel and study. Some argue that students should acquire a second language once they attend school whilst others contend that they should start during secondary school. It is obvious that learning a second language early in earlier childhood can enhance students’ international competitiveness in both academic and career aspects. On the contrary, the amount of time can be invested in sensory motor development if young kids start learning foreign languages during secondary education, leading to better holistic development. From my perspective, I believe that the two ideations stand their ground, depending on the parenting styles. \n\nUndoubtedly, language abilities such as speaking and writing skills are inherently important assets for people who pursue international study and overseas employment. Take Hong Kong as an example, English is a core subject in the standard proper education system, which requires students to learn as early as in kindergartens. Most of the learners in Hong Kong need to go through intensive English training during their study journeys. As a result, the majority of Hong Kong students are capable of using Chinese and English upon graduation, leading to a solid bilingual background for them to strike for better chances in employment in multinational companies and to study abroad, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. (compared to neighbouring cities such as those Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan, HK students speak better English because they start it at an early stage\n\nOn the flip side, instead of a new language, parents can focus on the sensory-motor training, which is valuable for the early development in child’s the infancy stage. For example, an increasing numbers of parents nowadays tend to provide training in swimming for toddlers because this sport can effectively build up their physical strength and coordination between body muscles, sensory systems and concentration ability. Apart from learning new languages, the development of these abilities can not be overlooked and the delay of language learning, when compared to a holistic development, can be deemed a reasonable action. \n\nTo sum up, both sides of this topic are supported by legitimate arguments about the advantages of their stands. Personally, I support that parents should let their children learn in the best interest of early childhood development, instead of blindly following either side. (blindly follow suit/ due to peer and social pressure)\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da trinh bay ca hai quan diem cua de bai va dua ra y kien cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people use new forms of technology to communicate these days. What are the positive effects of this trend on personal and professional relationships? Could online forms of communication lead to superficial connections?\"\nEssay:\n\"In our modern time, people relay information differently as a result of technological advancement. In my opinion, relationships have, for the most part, improved in two major ways through this phenomenon. I am also convinced the use of new means of communication, made available through the Internet, could potentially give rise to less meaningful interactions.\n\nIt is my view that, on a personal level, technology has enabled us to stay in touch more easily. People used to communicate through the postal system if they wished to contact someone who lived far from them. This system was cumbersome and often led to loss of connection. Through programs such as Skype or WhatsApp, everyone can now speak to their friends and relatives around the world whenever they please. In addition, whereas working professionals had limited opportunity to get to know their colleagues before, they can, at the present time, use various websites to find out about them. Website such as Instagram or LinkedIn have helped staff members to find common interests to talk about at work.\n\nI further believe that Internet-based platforms sway individuals into staying connected mainly in the virtual world. For example, there are people who have hundreds of friends on sites such as Facebook, yet they rarely speak to them about important issues in life. Another reason why relationship mat at times remain superficial could be attributed to impaired social skills. Since some people refrain from socializing in real-life situations and instead chat with others through the Internet, they fail to establish deep connections through face-to-face communication. The youth, in particular, might prefer to spend their time online and miss the chance to practice their skills to form intimate relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, technological innovations have revolutionized both our personal and professional lives by allowing us to communicate with friends, relatives and colleagues less effortfully. We can also discover a lot more about others’ interests through social media. From my  perspective, however, since more people prefer to spend their time online, missing the chance to develop their social skills, engaging in cutting-edge forms of communication could diminish the depth of their relationships.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da neu ro quan diem ca nhan cua ban ve cac he qua tich cuc va tieu cuc cua cong nghe moi doi voi moi quan he ca nhan va chuyen nghiep.

I completely agree with this statement as digital shopping saves our time and our effort. \n\nFirst of all, I believe that e-shopping can save the customer time. ordering online products doesn't take much time such as market store, the client can apply for any item from online platforms easily the process can take only 10 minutes. For instance, Shein is a familiar website for both gender clothes, that website provides the purchaser with high quality and speed delivery in 7 days . This is why an enormous number of people tend to purchase their products online. \n\n \n\nSecondly, online shopping saves people's efforts. Moreover, it provides variety among the products. On website-based retails the customer doesn’t need to visit it or move from his place to buy any items, it is a very simple since the person doesn’t care about how far the spot of  the wanted shop is or the transportation. For instance, Talabat is an Egyptian online market that includes all categories of foods and supermarket items, this application can deliver the product to the client whatever where his spot and with cheap delivery fees. So most  people tend to buy their items through online shopping. \n\nTo summarise,  online shopping nowadays is very popular as its assists the person to save  time as well to keep his efforts besides there are many items and varieties on it so the client can find what he or she needs easily.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la danh gia chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach khang dinh rang mua sam truc tuyen dang thay the mua sam truc tiep o cua hang.\n- Tuy nhien, y tuong cua ban chi tap trung vao viec mua sam truc tuyen tiet kiem thoi gian va cong suc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Please help with the evaluation of the below essay.\n\nMore and more people are choosing ready to eat food rather than cooking themselves. Do this development has more advantages than disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"In today's modern world, many people choose to buy meals in a restaurant than cook in the house. Both of these choices have advantages and disadvantages in taste, price, time, and nutrition. This essay will discuss these views and give a conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, buying ready-to-eat meals is better for both customers and owners. To begin with customers, they get more space to do other jobs because they don't spend an hour cooking. Furthermore, this option is a good choice for one who can not cook. People also can choose many kinds of bread that can be bought based on their nutrition, taste, countries, etc. Moreover, the cafe owner will hire many staff to cook and serve the cuisine in their cafe, so it will decrease the level of unemployment. For instance, students who graduate with a cooking major can find jobs easily because there is a lot of job vacancy in restaurants.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many eateries that falsify their foodstuff content. For example, there is a bakery that sells vegan bread, but in ,fact they cook it using non-vegan ingredients. We, as customers also hard to make sure that the cuisine process is as clean as the government's standards. There is a lot of case of poisoning and allergies caused by restaurant food. So, buying ready-prepared cuisine is not always the best choice for humans.\n\nIn conclusion, buying meals in an eating place is a good choice if we have no hours to cook, but always make sure to buy from certified eateries to avoid disease. I strongly believe that the public can search on the internet or ask friends for recommended restaurants before buying a portion of a meal from there.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. \n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"Bringing people together through music is the topic of discussion. I strongly agree that music is a way to bring different people from different ages and cultures together. \n\nThe first reason is about the easiest way that music can be heard due to living in a high technology world which can be shared and listened to music. For instance,  western culture and the middle east, these days merge together by downloading each music and listening deeply to it. So, music is a way to bring the community together by hearing it. \n\nThe second reason would be about the production of music and it tells people about the past and the origin of humans. Because  it shows people that humans are the same and they are living for one common goal. For example, a song had been written down by an American singer who wants to let people around the globe that they are human and they need freedom. Hence, music can say the things that happen in the past and what is human for.\n\nSome may argue that music cannot be a good way to bring individuals from different cultures together because everyone cannot hear the music. However, thanks to electricity and technology everyone has a radio in their houses and can use it easily. \n\nIn conclusion, music is an important way to bring people together of different ages and cultures due to 2 reasons which are the easiest way to hear and the content of the music that is about the human region and human past, however; some may have an opposite idea which is not reasonable for me.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va de cap den y tuong chinh mot cach day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Shopping is becoming more and more popular as a leisure activity. However, some people feel that this has both positive and negative effects.\n\nWhy is shopping so popular?\n\nWhat effects does its increase in popularity have on individuals and on society?\"\nEssay:\n\"In contemporary society, the number of people who spend their leisure time shopping is increasing, while some argue that this trend can affect people in both advantageous and disadvantageous ways. The reasons behind this phenomenon will be discussed in the following essay along with the effects of it on both individual and social perspectives.\n\nThere are many factors that result in the popularity of shopping, and the major one is that this activity can provide a perfect social atmosphere for the general public. That is because during the process of shopping, it is natural for people to talk about the clothes they try, the decoration styles of shops, and price changes of the brands they love, thereby, people can never feel awkward because of losing topics when shopping. In addition, they can find their similar aesthetic preferences about clothes in this procedure, leading to a deeper understanding and a fostered connection with their friends. For example, Maci, the largest shopping centre in Boston, is full of shoppers who see shopping as their best way to relax and get along with close friends, according to  recent research by Harvard.\n\nThe increasing popularity of shopping can have effects on individuals and society as a whole. On an individual level, people can get sufficient exercise at the time of shopping, because people believe the comparison is the key factor to find their favourite clothes, and this requires a long distance walk in most cases, which could be undoubtfully beneficial to people who have to sit for an extended period of time in working days. On the other hand, this trend can also benefit the whole society because it can promote businesses. With more people willing to shop, entrepreneurs can sell their products at a quicker speed, leading to less storage and a larger amount of cash flow in their accounts. Therefore, they can afford to invest in the development of new products and machines, resulting in a prosperous economy in the entire country.\n\nIn conclusion, there is an increasing number of people who take shopping as their favourite leisure activity because they can talk with friends and foster their connections in this progress, and this trend can be both advantageous to individuals by allowing for enough exercise and becoming healthier, and to the society as a whole by promoting the economy.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve ly do vi sao mua sam tro nen pho bien va tac dong cua no den ca nhan va xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries, people throw away a lot of food from restaurants and shops.\n\nWhy do you think people waste food in this way?\n\nWhat can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that a huge amount of food in restaurants and shops is thrown away all around the globe. In my opinion, this happens because of some reasons, and there are several actions that need to be taken to address this in order to mitigate such waste.\n\nA range of reasons why tons of cooking are being discarded. Firstly, some grub or drink lose their quality after a very short period of time when reserved. This is because such meals usually have genetically modified ingredients to improve their taste. These components are presented in some meals at fast food brands, for instance, which makes them impossible for refrigerating or warming up. Furthermore, another significant reason is the culture of a society. To illustrate, the vast majority of families in some countries order much more food as a kind of generosity and kindness. These people usually attend many events on a daily basis such as lunch invitations or dinners, and to show how they care about their friends and therefore, they request these high amounts of food. Consequently, immense amounts are thrown away.\n\nEffective solutions should be proposed to tackle the issue described above.First and foremost, to reduce the danger of this problem and food being wasted, governments should act more by implementing rules and regulations on shops by forcing them to reduce the harmful ingredients in these grubs. By putting a limit on such damaging ingredients, leftover food potentially lasts longer for use since there are no negative effects from chemicals. Another way to solve this problem is that the community should take into consideration that there are many people suffering from starvation and it might be better to help people who are in danger of poverty by feeding them extra amounts. In this way, food is not only being made the best use of it but also contributes to preventing being wasted.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the consequences of a society in some places should be maintained and the government should also have a vital role in minimizing the volume of useless contents in meals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi cau hoi de bai:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai, nhung can duoc cai thien de trinh bay y kien ro rang va chi tiet hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It has been suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is suggested by some professionals is obligated to learn about how to cultivate some plants and preserve animals in their life. I personally believe this trend would bring many benefits compared to the drawbacks. \n\nThere are two significant benefits of children for this argument such as enhancing their knowledge about organic foods and how to treat animals well. To begin with, In modern life, people are bombarded with the advert for fast food which can bring negative impacts on an individual’s health in the long run. This trend can be prevented by raising awareness among young people in terms of plant-based food since they are in primary school. For instance, many entry-level academic institutions equipped their programmes with planting modules. As a result, students know about types of organic vegetables including their nutrients which had a positive impact on their health. Furthermore, children in nature are really curious about some animals, by teaching them how to preserve it will level up their responsibility to take care of animals and raise their awareness about their sense of caring for some endangered animals in the future. \n\nOn the other hand, it is obvious there are disadvantages to this trend, the safety issue for example, we have seen in modern agriculture usually utilize pesticide chemicals to avoid strikes of insects. This chemical is identified as a hazardous compound which can cause severe dermatitis and eye damage in children as well as the soil also the habitat of several bacteria which can be harmful to children’s health. As an illustration, there are some cases experienced diarrhoea after conducting planting activities in the garden.\n\n In conclusion, by considering both approaches, I personally feel that the advantage in this aspect has a slight edge over the drawbacks.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve y kien cua ban ve viec tre em tieu hoc nen hoc cach trong rau va nuoi dong vat.

One of the first ways is to educate the public while other groups think this way isn't\n\n correct.\n\nThe first group thinks if society knows everything about their daily diet and they understand the positive point about eating a healthy snack like milk, meat, vegetable, yoghurt, water etc, they encourage to eat a healthy meal while there are plenty of factors that a person decides to change their diet.\n\nFor example, if the population know the effect of diet on their healthy while they don't have enough many don't have a way to exchange their life then\n\n they follow their life the same as past.\n\nsecond-team thinks that education isn't enough motivation to people try to alter their daily diet. they believe there are many reasons that government should handle them until the crowd can change their diet and eat healthy food.\n\nFor example, if government handle the prices of meat, dairy, beans, vegetable etc and try to reduce them until the people's purchasing power will increase and they can eat them then they can receive protein and vitamins etc as a result\n\n, society has a healthy community.\n\n In conclusion, I disagree with them because both of them are important. the community will know anything education about healthy diet and they know how they can increase their life span and the government should support the population in prices of products until the crowd can make a good decision about diet.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nNhiem vu cua ban la ban luan ve quan diem cua hai nhom nguoi voi nhau ve viec giao duc co du de giai quyet van de an uong khong lanh manh hay khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people argue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern world, public services and facilities have a huge impact on people's lives. According to government funds, some individuals believe that these ought to be spent on numerous facilities, namely transportation, security, education and  healthcare services, whereas other individuals think more money should be spent on works of art. I totally agree with the statement above and I will reveal my ideas in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, the society would benefit, if the state provides them with necessary services. By improving the medical sphere, the nation would be healthy and as a consequence, work and study for the development of their own country.        \n\nMoreover, if the education sphere would be fully funded by the government, the population would continue to develop and compete with other countries, in terms of knowledge.\n\n Also, looking at public  transportation systems, by spending money on this, the population will not spend cash on private autos, and as a,result the rates of happiness will increase dramatically. Furthermore, in the case that it is safe to live in a particular region and the crime rates are low, it would  appeal to and attract masses of tourists, which might generate a money flow into the country,  as a consequence the state would continue to develop . For instance, islands such as Madagascar, Maldives and Bali  generate 90% of their money from tourism.\n\nIn conclusion, in my perspective, the best way to allocate government funds is to serve the basic needs of its population, which may consequently guarantee a vivid and successful future for the whole nation and the country itself.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowdays many students have the opportunity to study some or all of their course in a foreign country. Do the advantages outweigh disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this modern era, the world become widened.So, Students have many opportunities to study in their home country or in  foreign countries but there are some pros and cons to this matter.Which are written in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with,There are some disadvantages to studying in foreign lands.First and foremost the reason is money.The expense of study is very high in the out of country.Hence, middle-class families do not afford that much of an amount due to their having to borrow money as well as they have to take big loans for their studies.Furthermore, students have to do part-time jobs because the cost of their housing and grocery are very high so this lid to them doing the extra jobs.So, they do not have  time for their study and that causes anxiety in the students.For example, Country like Canada and The USA students do labour jobs because the college fees and the rent of houses are too much. Therefore, they do not have any other option.\n\nNevertheless, there are some other sides to this view. Students want to study abroad because they know that after graduation they have numerous amount of opportunities in their field job.Moreover, We all know that in a foreign country, in each and every field people get a good job and earn ample amounts of money. Fields like computers have huge demand in  foreign countries. For instance, Students get the opportunity to work in  big companies like Google, Apple and Amazon and reaching on a good post.\n\nIn addition, the other reason is that they get freedom in  overseas. They do not have to follow social rules and regulations. They can live without any burden on society.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many individuals believe that youngsters who commit dangerous crimes like  robbery or a violent attack should be punished in the same as adults. I totally disagree with this statement and This essay will discuss both sides of this matter and How will be solved and handled it.\n\nFirstly, There is many reason  why youth are involved in critical problems day by day. Besides, reasons that poverty in people So, wealthy individuals misused  the poor people's weaknesses for their profits such as for smuggling of drugs, weapons as well as girls. Secondly, youngsters are obsessed with luxury cars and lavish lifestyles then they want good life so they choose the wrong way because they think it is a very fast way and they will become rich in their life For instance, Movies and social media play a very biggest role in their life, young generation take ideas or strategy in films how to commit robbery or  violent action in real life. \n\nfurthermore, Government should change the punishment rules different for minors and  open a school for education so that they know about their decisions and How to exit their critical situations in future and what is good for them Although, Government provide awareness of Self-defence is most important for youth. \n\nIn conclusion, nowadays impoverishment is the biggest problem in my nation So that's why, minors attempt crimes and some richest people use them for their strength and innocence for their benefit and to spoil youngster's futures.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"We always say that there is a generation gap and there always will be. What causes generation gap?\n\nIs there no way to strike a balance in the relations between two generations?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this constantly evolving technological era, there has always been a generation gap and there are numerous reasons behind this gap. Meanwhile, this gap can be balanced. Both ideas,  along with the conclusion at the end, would be perused in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, there are a plethora of causes behind a generation gap and the foremost reason is constantly evolving technology, which is making it hard for  people to cover the generation gap as throughout the globe various new advancements are taking place that are changing the way the masses work at professional as well as personal level. To cite an example, in India, the elderly who are more than 60 years find it difficult to use automobiles and operate  computers because 50 years ago, the technology was not developed completely. Moreover, in the countryside areas, they even do not know how to operate mobile phones. Consequently,  technology is developing at a rapid rate, which makes it difficult for  old people to keep themselves up-to-date with the latest in the industry.\n\nNevertheless, the generation can be covered and balanced by implementing various methods and techniques. The most \n\nthe dominant way is to run awareness campaigns at public places so that older people who visit these places can be aware of the latest in technology. For this, the higher authorities should come forward. For example, most of the senior citizens visit different public places like gardens, public libraries, and more; when awareness campaigns would be run at such places, the old people will become to know how to operate cars and use laptops.\n\nIn a nutshell, although the generation gap is quite long to cover and balance, it can be reduced if all individuals and the legislation take an expedient step to grasp the nettle of this problem. Moreover, the youngsters should assist their grandparents to cover the gap by teaching them how to use automobiles and other things.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach neu ra nguyen nhan gay ra khoang cach giua cac the he va cach de giam thieu khoang cach do.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people send and receive emails in business and in their personal life. Do the advantages of using the email outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"A large number of people utilize the email service to carry out their professional tasks and for attending to their personal affairs. While there are some drawbacks associated with using this means of communication, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.\n\nOn the one hand, a potential disadvantage may be misapprehension resulting from an email exchange. Since emotions and tone of speech are, at times, difficult to convey properly through the written form, the content of an email, too, might upset or aggravate someone. For instance, a manager’s announcement could sound forceful when organizing a meeting with the staff through email and frustrate the employees. Another negative is receiving unwanted electronic mail known as spam. These messages contain harmful pieces of virus. I, personally, become rather alarmed when my inbox is cluttered by spam.\n\nOn the other hand, a primary advantage of using the email service is fast communication. Whereas in the past, hand-written letters used to take a long time to be delivered, the email technology has made it possible to send and receive mail almost instantly. In business, where people tend to make work-related arrangements on a daily basis, using this service is extremely useful. A further benefit is that the email is accessible in most places around the globe. If one wishes to contact their friends or relatives overseas, there is a good chance that they will be able to connect to the Internet and send an email.\n\nOn balance, it is true that using emails to exchange information would seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive effects on the speed of communication as well as the accessibility of this service override the downsides.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va neu ra duoc nhung y tuong chinh lien quan den viec su dung email.

Call-up periods in the military service  show that there are too many soldiers in Turkey. Thanks to paid military duty are discussed on the agenda over social media. It�s claimed that it is going to be formed in unfair and injustice mention ways for non-financial conditions. However, many populations argue that paid military account needs to be implemented. Seeing  this military office by payment provides economic benefits and this issue will be contributing to much more productivity for young society without breaking their careers long time.\n\n\n\nFirstly, paid military work law supplies income to the Turkish economy. Our economy has been stuck in an economic trouble period for years.In such a period, it might be so beneficial to be obtained by the government for the country's needs/ volunteer military duty budget.

Nonetheless, it is argued that the nation that would like to counter their country in case of any war considers a retrogression among the Turkish people.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"There are severe social consequences to housing shortages in cities and only the government can solve these problems.\n\n\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many believe that governments are the only figures capable of addressing the accommodation shortage in cities and alleviating dire social consequences because of it. In this essay, I will argue that tackling this massive socioeconomic problem requires a significant power at the size of government powers as the authorities have the power of legislation to coordinate these projects as well as unlimited financial resources compared to the private sector.\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for agreeing with the issue of housing shortage being merely solvable by the political authorities is that they have the power of placing executive orders to benefit their attempts. No private sector has this advantage to compete with them; resulting in being the only force capable of handling hindered issues like metropolitan accommodation. For instance, they could allocate a budget from other sectors like the oil industry to spend on housing projects or simply raise taxes in order to gain more money.  By contrast, the private sector lacks such abilities to manage projects to the extent of tackling metropolis housing issues.\n\n\n\nMoreover,  in spite of being cautious about spending their belongings, governments have unlimited resources of income to allocate budgets for possible projects. They have annual income along the lines of trillions of dollars, particularly in developed countries, from sources like tax, natural resources such as fossil fuels, etc., to plan any construction without being wary of their finances running out. The United States, for example, spends more than 5 trillion dollars every year in different schemes to improve their citizen's life. Hence, governments often have large budgets to finance different programs every year.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that states are the sole figures capable of resolving the shortage of housing in big cities on the grounds that they not only have the power of imposing laws and giving orders for their desired objectives but also their number of resources make them the only viable option for significant projects like housing.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai bang cach cho rang chi co chinh phu moi co the giai quyet van de thieu nha o o cac thanh pho va cac he qua xa hoi nghiem trong ma no gay ra.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"According to me as children go to  the school at very young  age  like six or seven-years-old have advantagesadvantages as well as disadvantages too. My opinion is discussed below.\n\n\n\nFirstly, as a  children go to a school as young age have some benefits likes.  When kids are 5 years old as there a parents are working then it is good for the  children if they go to the  institution. If the   people will go to the  institution very early than they will spend less time with there parents. As they will go to the  schooling then word load will be more on them. For example, a child will go to  the schooling then will learn new things and will meet new people.\n\n\n\nSecondly, there are also some disadvantage of kids who go to institution at early age they are. For example, if the  child will stay at the  house then he will meet less people. Thirdly, if the  people go at 5 years age then the  teacher should give less homework. There should be less study for this students. For  the group its better to go after 6 or 7  years.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, going the  school have both sides advantage and disadvantage. As mentioned above  the parsent should sent there the  children at primary in the age at 6 years. In my opinion, as disuss above go primary after 6 years have more benefits.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some experts believe that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. Do the advantages of this weigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"Primary school education has always impacted a student in some way. A good primary education program would not only build the student interest towards studies, it also encourages student to expore more about himself. Primary learning plays a very vital role than the secondary school.\n\n\n\nPrimary educational strategies should also include teaching both national and international language to students. Teaching languages at lower classes is vital for learners. \n\n\n\nThe guidance and teaching for foreign languages such as English, German, Chinese etc,. should be motivated. There are several benefits associated to learning a language at early stage. The primary classes should atleast focus to teach one of the foreign languages. The best strategy is to teach a globally accepted language named as English. When a person will start learning the language from the beginning, he would be able to have a strong grip over the reading, writing, speaking, and listening. In the younger ages, the human brain is more active and is capable of absorbing things. Learning from a low level also helps the student to understand the syntatically and semantically correct meaning of word of language. Moreover, this could also be valuable for the student to increase the vocabulary. \n\n\n\nThe foreign language could be the valueable assets for the people who intend to have a higher education from abroad. In addition, when the person starts his career, he should be capable enough to present his thoughts in words. This would not only help him to settle and get a better job within a country but it might also act as a stroger tool to earn a chance of working in some foreign organization. \n\n\n\nAlong with a lot of pros, there are some cons such as the student might not attentive to learn more about the national language but the benefits linked with the learning and engaging through a foreign language are always greater than learning a secondary level. Secondary level studies should be more focuing towards the direction in which child wants to excel. \n\n\n\nTo sum up, the primary education acts as a base therefore, it is highly recommended to make a learner learn foreign language at primary level rather than secondary standard. Foreign language always opens up more paths in a longer run.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da trinh bay loi ich cua viec hoc ngon ngu nuoc ngoai o tieu hoc va cung nhac den cac nhuoc diem co the xay ra.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Success is often measured in wealth and material belongings. Do you think wealth is the best measure for success? What makes a person successful?\"\nEssay:\n\"What stands out while gauging success is the amount of money and material possessions. However, I am convinced that affluence is not a reliable barometer of success and a sense of satisfaction along with self-consciousness are of greater importance from my standpoint.\n\n\n\nThere are two main reasons why the concept of success cannot be measured by opulence. To begin with, wealth can be obtained effortlessly. To put it another way, if money is not reaped of hard work, people from high social strata should no longer be admired. Take well-off families who have bequeathed their inheritance to the next generation as an example; their familial financial wealth does not give their children�s success a seal of approval. Secondly, hardly can anyone deny the fact that some massive achievements in life yield a high level of return either too late or never, namely artists and scientists in the history of mankind.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, people can achieve success by deriving great satisfaction as well as introspection. As for contentment, ones, irrespective of their financial status, can flourish, provided that they acquire expertise useful. People can hone skills giving them a competitive edge either in academic or professional fields. A lucid example of this is getting a job they have always dreamed of, thereby finding deep contentment in their life. People, moreover, can obtain a better understanding of both themselves and the essence of life by working on their inner feelings, despite the whole world propelling them towards material success, which is nothing but a shallow perception.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, a person�s success seems to have no correlation with luxury items or plenty of money. Meanwhile, I strongly believe that those having a great understanding of who they are and trying to gain more satisfaction in their life are the true successful people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCo the noi rang ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong cua ban da duoc mo rong day du.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.\"\nEssay:\n\"A growing number of students place a premium on pursuing their higher education abroad. Although attending foreign universities than their own countries has many benefits, the drawbacks involved are  important to be discussed.\n\n\n\nOn the plus side, it appears that studying abroad proves beneficial. The first benefit is concerned with more opportunities in the target country. Simply put, young people continue their studies in universities where studying is supposed to be more facilitated in comparison with their home country. This in turn paves the way for either academic or professional progress, affecting manifold aspects of their life. An obvious example of this situation is an avid student from a developing country looking for well-equipped laboratories in order to find a cure for hard-curable diseases such as cancer, by which the whole world would no longer be threatened. Students� networks, moreover, could be enhanced as they collaborate with international peers and academics, thereby boosting the chance of employability in the upcoming opportunities.\n\n\n\nHaving said that, the downside of receiving overseas education should not be underestimated. To begin with, if their ideology or race is improperly introduced to the world, non-native students are likely prone to discrimination. As a direct result, all their attempt for integrating into society would fail and they are left with nothing but a traumatic experience. Take a young girl from an Islamic country for example; what may come under fire when she enters the campus with her Muslim-themed appearance is the idea of being a terrorist, permeating other classmates� minds by the power of media. Another evident disadvantageous side is the high costs of the living in foreign countries, especially progressive ones, such as America. Newcomers should burden the cost of maybe prohibitive tuition fees or accommodation, which were up to their parents heretofore.\n\n\n\nOn balance, the tendency of studying overseas would be both rewarding and problematic. While it may guarantee their future remarkable achievements and provide them with more opportunities, students are highly likely to suffer from harassment as well as financial difficulties.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va neu ro loi ich va nhuoc diem cua viec hoc tai nuoc ngoai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people fail to achieve a balance between work and other parts of their lives. What are the reasons and how to solve the problem\"\nEssay:\n\"Maintaining a balance between work and other aspects of life has become increasingly challenging for many individuals. This essay explores the reasons behind this struggle and provides effective strategies to address this issue so as to foster a healthier work-life balance.\n\n\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the difficulties in balancing work and life. Firstly, the availability of technological devices and communication tools has blurred the boundaries between professional and personal life. Constant connectivity makes it almost unfeasible to disconnect from work, resulting in extended working hours. Secondly, workplace culture and societal expectations often prioritize productivity and long working hours over personal well-being. Thirdly, personal ambition and the desire to succeed professionally can lead individuals to neglect their personal lives, causing an imbalance.\n\n\n\nTo strive for work-life harmony, one should define specific working hours and create designated spaces for working tasks and relaxation and communicate these boundaries with colleagues and family to manage expectations. Besides, recognizing the importance of self-care activities, such as exercise, hobbies, and spending quality time with loved ones, is the key to reaching equilibrium. People should schedule regular breaks, engage in activities that bring joy and relaxation, and practice mindfulness or meditation to recharge and rejuvenate. What is more, it is crucial to learn how to manage time efficiently by prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and avoiding multitasking. In the meanwhile, one needs to be able to identify time-wasting routines and minimize distractions, maximizing productivity and leaving room for personal activities.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, retaining a work-life balance determines one�s overall happiness. By setting boundaries, prioritizing self-care, and managing time effectively, individuals can create a more balanced and fulfilling life, integrating both personal and professional spheres harmoniously.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that products should be made to last as long as possible, while others think making the products cheap is more important.\n\n\n\nDiscuss both views and express your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is asserted that the durability of products is of great importance. However, cost-effectiveness is a key factor that appears to have a number of proponents. I advocate the former group.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, some advocate the idea of more reasonably-priced products. To begin with, having a voracious appetite for shopping affordable goods, people encourage a consumer-driven manufacturing process by which production lines would be expanded. Under this circumstance, more job opportunities could be made and the wheels of industry will be kept turning. An obvious example of this is China, known for its mass production. Not only has it recruited many locals, but also an array of jobs have been developed around the world. Furthermore, supporters of affordable goods claim that class disparity could be less apparent. Simply put, all walks of life would be able to accommodate their needs even the proletariat whose desires have been suppressed.\n\n\n\nHowever, the longevity of goods takes priority in other people�s opinion. The first compelling reason is that a culture of consumerism would no longer be promoted. In other words, when products last for a long time, people, irrespective of their purchasing power, try not to give in to the urge to go shopping. This is clearly delineated in a society where the trend-led approach to purchasing fashion clothing is rejected and replaced by slow fashion, focusing on conscious buying and thoughtful purchases. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between built-to-last items and their positive impacts on the environment. To put it another way, the more sustainable material is used, the less environmentally damaging waste, such as plastic, would be dumped, leading to securing the future of our planet.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, I would tend to side with those supporting longevity when it comes to purchasing. It seems to be unreasonable to put the environment in jeopardy by generating more waste and seems more logical to prevent the mass discarding of goods and consumerist culture.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va de cap den ca hai quan diem duoc yeu cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, owning a home rather than renting renting one is very important for people.\n\nWhy might ths be the case?\n\nDo you think this is a positive or negative situation?\"\nEssay:\n\"In some nations, families prefer to buy homes rather than rent ones and house ownership is essential for them. I firmly believe this statement has positive effects on all family members. In this essay, the causes of this demand and its effects will be discussed.\n\nSocially, homeownership might project a positive and pleasant image in some cultures. It is psychologically proven that it can definitely give nations more stability and peace of mind. To be more specific it leads to enhancing the level of comfort and welfare in families and individuals who live in their own homes don't need to be worried about their landlord's decision and they are least likely to encounter tough situations in the living place.\n\nIn addition, in terms of investments folks who purchase places of living will have a reliable source of savings. For instance, the public simply witnessed the families who bought their house, they made a noticeable profit because of inflation in a number of countries the price of buying a house is on the rise. it has been a growing concern for people, therefore people are constantly making an effort to buy a home.\n\nOn the other hand, some opponents claim that living in their own homes makes people restricted and decreases their mobility. For example, if their workplace is changed, they could barely change their home and have to drive long-distance to reach their office.\n\nTo conclude, although living in own home might lead to restrictions for folks, I hold the opinion that its advantages outweigh its disadvantages. In fact, it gives people a chance to get away from the tension and stress which may be created by renting a house.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTong the, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong cua ban da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Around the world, people are now living longer than ever before in the past. Some say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Others believe there are benefits to society having more elderly people.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is undeniable that the life expectancies of  people are increasing during the last few decades. \n\nThis is because of the safe habitats and the advanced treatments for various diseases. Though some people believe that these seniors are a burden for the country, some advocacies still exist on their behalf. In my opinion, I think  societies still need the elder public and the way they serve the countries and the families can eradicate the drawbacks.\n\nOn the one hand, these aged people can work with the government and private sectors. Since they are vastly experienced, they can help the authorities in decision makings. For example, during the corona epidemic, the health department of Bangladesh formed an advisory body to monitor the situation and provide  advice. As a result, the number of deaths and infections was relatively low. Additionally, these citizens can be used as trainers in various fields where they will train  youngsters. Furthermore, working parents can leave their children with their grandparents at home safely and can save on the cost of daycare centres. \n\nOn the other hand, some public believe that as the elderly population can not work with the regular workforce and take gratuities from the state, they are a burden. Western countries are paying a lot of money for  treatments and food, for example. If the money can be spent on other essential sectors. But since these people had contributed to building the societies, the treatments and other facilities are their rights. \n\nIn conclusion, there are some downsides to having  elders in a great number, but their contributions  still can be regarded positively and that's why I completely disagree with the claim.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan essay cua ban da dap ung phan Task Response mot cach day du va chinh xac.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people say that in order to keep fit we should all join the gym. Some people, however, think that we can exercise at home and in parks. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"A group of individuals present the view that the gym is the sole place where people can improve their fitness level, whereas others believe that exercising outdoors or even at home is adequate. I strongly agree with the latter opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, some people justifiably argue that exercising outside the gym is far less stressful. It is certainly true that the gym often puts too much mental pressure on individuals to look good. For example, a few of my friends, who are overweight, recently joined the gym, but quickly terminated their membership contracts because they felt stressed out. They told me that almost everyone there looked lean and self-assured. Indeed, the gym can be a threatening environment to those who wish to exercise without feeling self-conscious. Thus, joining a fitness center is not sensible for many people who may be insecure about their weight or physical abilities.\n\nOn the other hand, another group of people claim that one needs special exercise machines and state-of-the-art equipment to improve their fitness. They insist that people cannot exercise properly without employing a personal trainer, available at the gym. However, I am not convinced by this argument since most forms of exercise can be performed elsewhere too. Jogging, which is a cardiovascular exercise and recommended by doctors, can be done in parks. Also, people can engage in weight-bearing exercise such as push-ups and planks in the home.\n\nTo conclude, in my view, we do not have to join the gym in order to be physically active. Some individuals could even be demoralized by going to a fitness center since they would feel the pressure to look attractive and strong. People, instead, can perform numerous exercise routines at home or in the park without the undue stress experienced at the gym.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nThuc hien Task Response cua ban kha tot, vi ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va phat trien y tuong cua minh mot cach day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some areas of the us a curfew is imposed in which teenagers are not allowed to be out of doors after a particular time at night unless they are accompanied by adults. What is your opinion about this?\"\nEssay:\n\"Mostly the restrictions are imposed in the early teenages. Through this passage, I got an opportunity to share my opinion regarding the teenage curfew. \n\nAs it has been noted, there are several area in the US where the children in their younger ages are not allowed to leave their place during certain the hours of a day. There are two schools of thoughts for this security condition. Firstly, a few people believe controlling children in their early ages plays a significant role in building a strong personality of child. It is necessary to apply curfew conditions due to the reason the kids at this age start to think they are more powerful. Moreover, they may also take bold steps, in addition, sometimes they may indulge themselves in bad things. Furthermore, these bad steps could be the utlizating drugs and stealing items from others. Additionally, they may find it appealing to group up with the gangsters. At this age they might not be able to understand and correct their bad actions themselves rather they need a support from their elders siblings, parents, teachers, and the law enforcement agencies.\n\nIn my opinion, this innitiative is very important. As far as i think, all the countries should enforce curfew during a fixed time. This would be a great effort to stop people from developing bad habits. Moreover, through this, there will be huge decrease in crime rate of a region. The government should heavily fine the kid and the parent who breaks the law. Because law enforcement is only way to control the teenage residents of country from taking worst actions.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach the hien mot y kien ro rang ve viec ap dung lenh gioi nghiem doi voi tuoi teen.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Shopping is becoming more and more popular as a leisure activity. However, some people feel that this has both positive and negative effects. Why is shopping so popular?\n\nWhat effects does its increase in popularity have on individuals and on society?\"\nEssay:\n\"Shopping is very popular among the majority of the population, despite their age or social standards. This is due to the fact that most people find shopping as an experience which makes a difference in their day to day life. Some people find themselves in a different world, surrounded by various material things which they may or may not be able to purchase. Even if they are not able to finance these, they find much pleasure in looking and feeling these things and Imagining owning them some day, some people go shopping when they really want to purchase things and they prefer to look around and compare the prices before buying them. I think most people love to go shopping because, then they could meet friends, make contacts with people, and get to know what is in the latest trend. It provides them a pleasant distraction from their routine and sometimes dull life.\n\nThe most important effect shopping has on an individual is that it nourishes the self-esteem. An individual may find the social contact most gratifying and this makes people come out of their shells and be more extrovert. Purchasing something, as well as knowing that you are financially able to purchase something give more self confidence to people.\n\nThe increase in popularity to go shopping has many effects on the society. People may be encouraged to go into new businesses and it will improve the economy. More job opportunities will be created for people in these businesses. Encouraged by the increase of popularity manufacturers will try to improve their products, so that the consumers can have a wide range of products at competitive prices. The overall quality of the product as well as the services provided by the sales staff will be improved.\n\nMore job opportunities will be created in advertising as the manufacturers try to sell their product. Consumers will have a better knowledge of the product. So that they will not be misleaded by inferior quality products.\n\nI find shopping an interesting and pleasurable experience, as each year passes by, simply because it enriches my heart and mind.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi tai sao mua sam tro nen pho bien va hieu ung cua su tang pho bien cua mua sam doi voi ca nhan va xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Increasingly, people eat food from other parts of the world rather than local food. What do you think is driving this trend? Is this a good or bad development?\"\nEssay:\n\"At present, the trend of exploring international cuisines and food from other culture has been on a rise compared to trying the local food. The constant exposure of Internet and social media and increasingly affluent society have made remarkable differences to this proliferating trend. The essay will discuss the factors that drive this trend as well as the benefits of the development.\n\nFirstly, the easy access to internet and social media have given the constant exposure to different culture and traditions covering the cuisines too. A significant number of people especially youngsters are attracted and curious to explore various ethnic food and practices. For instance, the food blogger Irfan from Chennai has garnered million followers to his food vlog videos where he travels to different countries to equip people with knowledge on various food items and the cuisines. This trend provides plethora of benefits to the tourism industry by attracting millions of visitors to travel. In addition, the cutting- edge technology and readily available information on websites exacerbate the interest of many to explore and taste.\n\nSecondly, the increasing affluence of the society can be another factor to look forward to explore and feast on international cuisines compared to local food which is ubiquitous everywhere. As we all know Singapore being the food paradise in Asia, the tourists are being drawn to the number of restaurants there. To epitome, the high -class restaurants and five star hotels in Singapore provide wide range of  international  buffets and array of local food items from all over the world to entice the hungry crowd. The melting pot of local culture in Singapore is also of utmost importance to build good bond and friendship with others.\n\nTo recapitulate, the support for local food as well as the exploration of international cuisine fetch benefits to both people and country.  By embracing different ethnic groups from other countries and   local culture, we can build a sustainable future in this shrinking world.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach thao luan ve yeu to dang thuc day xu huong nay va cung cap lap luan de ho tro quan diem cua ban.

Some of people think that social media has took teenagers life and spend all their time on using their cellphones, just for searching new followers in twitter, instagram, and Snapchat, and reduce their connected with real people on their lives. However, some of people believe that social media make the life of the teenagers even the elderly people make their life easer, by connected with each other by these apps and call each others by them. I personally feel that social media is not a good way to connected with people and build relationships with it.\n\nIn terms of building the relationships in social media, those people they know may be dangerous, first they seem nice but after a while they blackmail them to send their pictures or their house location so they can reach to them and hurt them. Social media it may be dangerous for children's and teenagers. It should be allowed for who are over 18 years old and also put some instructions teach them how to use these apps in a good and safety way.\n\nLots of people think that social media improve the connection of people and their families, but its wrong, the connected of people and their families its better to meet in a place or wherever they want, because when they meet each other they will be more happier and feel the power of their connection. \n\nIn conclusion, some of people believe that social media is dangerous for individuals and some of them think that the advantages of the social media are outweigh of disadvantages. However, the world would be much better if people stop using social media.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da khong tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more people are suffering from health problems caused by a modern life style which cannot be treated with modern medicines. Some people think that a return to traditional medicines should be encouraged. To what extent do you agree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In our modern days,it is believed that an increasing amount of people are suffering from health problems caused by our sedentary lifestyle,the problems of health can not be cured with modern medicines.Some people have an opinion that we ought to return to traditional medicine to treat the health problems.This essay mostly agrees with the statement and will give two reasons to back up my position.\n\n\n\nTo begin with,sometimes traditional medicine can surprisingly treat fatal diseases.In simple words,the health situation,where modern medicine can do nothing,traditional medicine can absolutely get rid of disease.For instance,there was a man that suffered from lung disease.Unfortunately,doctors said that he left to live only 4 months.However,the man have not wanted to die and did his best to cure his disease.,Afterwards he tried Kazakh national medicine, which involves drinking kumis and spending time in the steppe.Wonderly,when he came back and went to the hospital, doctors said that he somehow had cured the disease.This example precisely shows that we can rely on alternative medicine.\n\n\n\nSecondly,alternative medicine will not adversely affect  human organisms.What I wanted to say is that,the medicine only cures illnesses,given the fact that it is mostly made from plants,except for the chinese traditional medicine,which involves needles.Reversely,sometimes modern medicine can make our health condition worse,if the patient was cured unproperly.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion,traditional medicine can cure  situations where modern medicine is powerless.In ,addition alternative medicine only gives benefits to the human body.Not for one moment should you avoid traditional medicine.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach ung ho quan diem rang nen khuyen khich su dung lai thuoc co truyen de dieu tri cac van de suc khoe khong the chua tri bang thuoc hien dai.

While many people think this is advantageous there are people who believe this would result in major  drawbacks . \n\n\n\nOn one hand , it is important for young adults to travel the world so they acquire experience that could help them during their university period . For instance , it's very common in Europe for a family to send their children to a neighboring country alone so they learn how to overcome difficult situation such as traveling alone , getting a job etc , moreover it will help the young adults to obtain soft skills that the school will not provide and would have a significant impact on their lives . \n\n\n\nOn the other hand , traveling for a year could result is valuable time lost , nowadays the competition to get in to a university is quite competitive. Young adults should try to use this time to do an additional  course which would help their chances to get into universities much higher . For example , going to a workshop or trying for an internship would benifit an individual more than traveling outside for a year \n\n\n\nIn conclusion , traveling for a year before joining university might have a positive outcome however it could result in major disadvantages\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nPhan hoi ve Nhiem vu:\n\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai bang cach neu ra cac uu diem va khuyet diem cua viec cho phep thanh nien di du hoc hoac lam viec trong mot nam truoc khi bat dau hoc dai hoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more measures to improve the security in large urban areas have been introduced in many countries because of the increased crime. Do the benefits of these measure outweigh the drawbacks?\"\nEssay:\n\"Recently, in some countries, an increasing number of offenders is posing a threat to the society. Hence, more and more security cameras, surveilance equipments are prevail application in large urban areas to protect innocent people. This arrangement, despite seemingly disadvantageous in certain aspects, actually possesses merits that, in my opinion, would overshadow the drawbacks.\n\n\n\n    Regarding the drawbacks of using security cameras to deter crime, some people belive that the police has invaded their own privacy, and freedom. These days, the extensive of using special surveilance equipments is hardly escapable, to the point that the people may find themselves surrounded by those every walking moment. It does not matter where they are, they still being watched for 24 hours. Whether they are on the street, in the supermarket, or on a way home, images of their faces and their movement will be recorded and sent to the security organisations, ready to be analysed if necessary. Many people belive their right, their privacy are not be respected, and this action would be a violation of privacy. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn spite of the above arguments, I�m inclined to think the pros outweigh the cons. First and foremost, the most overwhelming advantage is that police can easily track the criminals once an individual commit an offence. Those devices can deter young offenders or potential criminals from breaking the laws, because they know that themselves being under the surveilance of cutting-edge devices. Furthermore, it would greatly contribute to reducing terrorist attacks, thanks to the data and images from these cameras, which are used to detect unusual activities of any individual in public places. The installation of more video cameras in urban areas is cost effective, and unobtrusive, while the goverment do not have to allocate too much money on the police forces. More importantly, this application will protect the society from any threat and provide a sense of safety and security to the people.\n\n\n\n  In a nutshell, the use of surveilance cameras as crime detterance is being increased in many big cities around the world. I hold the view that this application bring more merits than drawbacks, albeit objection of some people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, tong the la co phan hoi dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In spite of the advances in agriculture many people around the world still go hungry why why is this the case what can be done about this problem\"\nEssay:\n\"Food security is the most concern for every nation. Therefore, countries are investing much of their gross domestic income in agriculture. However, despite the improvement of the farming industry ,some places in the world still suffer from the food insecurity. In this essay we will look into the fact behind this and we will discuss solution for the above problem.\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, we should look into the fact why the food cultivation industry is still not cater evenly around the globe. Even though, the industrial development with advanced machineries available in developed-countries ,those are not evenly distributed among developing and poor income countries. On top of that, some countries are suffering from conflict for ages which in turn collapse the economy and food security. As well as, political instability is a  a huge added fact to this problem. In some places, poor decision making by the government make collapse in the cultivation field. For example, few years  in Sri Lanka suddenly banned all the chemical peptisides without gradually withdrawing it. Eventually, country suffered from a tremendous food shortage within one year. Although, facilities are available, poor decision making can trigger starvation in some areas of the globe.\n\n\n\nTo overcome   this problem, first there should be concrete agricultural policies which cannot be changed by the politicians. Other than that governing authorities should invest more on building infrastructure for agronomy. However, without proper workforce machineries are invain. Hence, educating the people involved with farming and generating new graduate graduates in crop-science field would be a long term solution for this problem.\n\n\n\n In conclusion, educating farmers and strengthening them with newer technological infrastructure would strength the food industry. While, they should be supported with the concrete policies not to cheat by the corrupt politicians or intermediary sellers .Consequently, this would strengthen the food security and get rid from the hunger in the world.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve ly do tai sao nhieu nguoi van di doi mac du da co su tien bo trong nong nghiep va cung cap cac giai phap cho van de nay.

On the other hand, some people say that the subjects that are related to science and technology are more dominant than history. History is past, and past is related to the things that have been done. So history teaches us from the past mistakes. So, history teaches us from the past mistakes that have been done in any field and we can learn from them. Whereas, science and technology made our lives easy by all means. In the past people have to travel for week to reach their destination, but science and technology makes it far easy by airplanes,trains,buses,cars and bikes. The travel that can take weeks in the past is now taking some hours.\n\n\n\nHistory is a subject that is able to consistently reminds us about the struggle of our ancestors. The struggle for independence. The struggles for keeping the countries safe. Moreover, some people are very fond of reading history books, and learning about their culture and customs.\n\n\n\nScience and technology are the subjects that keeps us connected to the modern world.

This lead to less owned field for person. Thereby, house prices will rise because rare things are more valuable.\n\n\n\nTo solve these above troubles, some plausible solutions could be taken thanks to the government�s help. Firstly, unified management of traffic fees and try to adjust them to a generally accepted range. And also, the government can propose for ride on a bicycle when traveling. Secondly, the state can provide some housing welfare, and decrease resident�s economic pressure. For instance, it can offer free rooms for families with many children. At the same time, the administration can set up temporary habitation for the employed.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I would contend that folks are being in difficulties with transportation and living spends, which makes them gradually drop satisfaction of the life environment.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Lack of fresh water is becoming a global issue of increasing importance. What problems does this shortage cause?\n\n\n\nWhat measures could be taken to overcome these problems?\"\nEssay:\n\"With the increasing of the population nowaday, the need for clean water is higher than ever. Despite that, many areas in the world still suffer from the lack of fresh water to use. This essay will discuss the cause and the way to solve the challenge.\n\n\n\nPrimarily, the water pollution is caused mostly by the trash dumping of the residents and the contaminated chemicals that are flushed away by the factories. Not only the cause of the garbage but also the awareness of people who always have a mindset that there will be cleaner to help them, but these activities will contribute significantly to the lack of fresh water in every place and can easily damage daily life.\n\n\n\nTo help reduce the problem, the main solution is to punish all the individuals and groups who dumped trash and chemicals into the water resources, which will decrease the rate of water pollution in the society. Then the government should help the people by installing the water filter in every household. This will make every family access to fresh water and no more worry about health when drinking contaminated water. Also the government should schedule filter changes every 6 months to retain the fresh water to all the families. Moreover, people should also raise other awareness by telling the benefits of having fresh water to the health of everyone. Or even set up a fresh water station in the public which is easier to access the clean water.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the cause of water shortage is mainly about the people and groups that pollute the sources and the main solution is to increase awareness and make more ways to help every people access to the cleaning water.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi phan yeu cau cua de bai bang cach neu ra y kien cua minh ve nguyen nhan gay ra su thieu hut nuoc sach va cung cap it nhat mot giai phap de giai quyet van de.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To\n\n\n\nwhat extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is an opinion for the future that in 30 years the most common form of education where the teacher makes a lesson in a classroom will cease to exist. I do not agree with such a statement and believe that a teacher would never be totally substituted by anything.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, I believe that by 2050 ways of teaching can change but it is difficult to predict how. I believe that even if the education would go fully online, the teacher would still be neededFor example, during the lockdown, a lot of people were forced to switch to distant studying, and then it turned out that this is quite convenient. There is also an opinion that in 30 years a lot of professions will be replaced by robots and machines. Some people even believe that a teacher will not be needed - all knowledge will be able to flow directly to a persons brain by using the latest technologies. I cannot agree with such a statement as I think that a teacher is necessary anyway you cannot find out all the needed details of a certain subject yourself.\n\n\n\nMoreover, I believe that it will not be possible to completely replace the teacher as it is much more pleasant to study having communication with a human, not a robot. We often need a mentor and his or her advice. In addition, there are special subjects that are best studied under the supervision of a teacher in the classroom. For example, it is better to conduct experiments in chemistry in the laboratory under the teacher�s control so that he or she can correct students mistakes in time without consequences.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den y kien cua ban la \"I do not agree with such a statement and believe that a teacher would never be totally substituted by anything.\" Tuy nhien, de cai thien Task Response, ban can bo sung them y kien va thong tin cu the de ung ho quan diem cua minh. \n\nBan nen mo rong cac y kien cua minh va cung cap vi du hoac bang chung cu the.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people prefer to live in hot climate, while others like to live in cold climate.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Climate has a significant impact on people’s lifestyle, such as the way to do exercise, to take a trip and to keep healthy. Some people think that it is more comfortable to live in high temperature, while others suggest that cold weather is more suitable for people to live in. I personally prefer to live in a hotter environment, and in this essay, I will make an explanation and discuss the two standpoints mentioned above.\n\nTo begin with, there are several advantages to live in hot climate. One benefit is that many outdoor activities. Take climbing, biking and jogging for example, these three exercises will be easier to do when the weather is great, and thanks to the long daytime, those who take part in these activities may have a better sight while doing them. Secondly, a higher heat often leads to a higher possibility to sweat. Admittedly, sweating may make people smell disgusting and feel uncomfortable; however, as everyone knows, it is undoubtedly an efficient way to help our bodies burn the unwanted fat. According to the World Health Organization, those who sweat more could stay in fit much easier since their sweat glands stay active most of the time.\n\nOn the other hand, from the perspective of the proponents of cold weather, they will choose to live in a cooler region because of the reasons below. Firstly, the storage of food may be much easier since the temperature degree is suitable to keep them fresh. Furthermore, with a lower temperature degree, the world become quitter and make people feel calm when working.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the benefits of cold weather, I would like to stay in hot climate region instead because I am a lover of outdoor activities, and I can not stand wearing too many clothes at one time which may make me look fatter.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve cac quan diem ve song trong khi hau nong va lanh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many students chose to complete at least some part of their university studies in a foreign country.\n\nWhat are some of the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, foreign studies have become moe popular than it was before. Therefore, numerous number of students chose their masters and phd program from foreign university. It seems to me that, development of this outcome will open many opportunity for students with degree from high ranked universities.\n\nTo begin with, United States and few other countries offer worlds top quality of higher educational programmes with best Ivey league university and business schools. However, many students after completing their under graduate studies from home college, majority of them going to apply for further degree or certification course in US, UK or Canada. In addition, if we compare state university to other foreign university, both will either lack proficiency in sort of education or expertises in providing them. But, foreign country will provide golden opportunity of internship program for students. As a result, many would discover new aspect in their lives, also benefits after receiving international degree.\n\nOn the other hand, some international programs will need to compete entrance exam, whenever students will return after their studies back to home county. Whereas, medical field in India and other continents have entrance exam for international students. If they are willing to get certification of doctors training and practices. For instance, this could create some negativity in community, who will get neglected to practice before proper examination. For example, because international studies could differ in various expect from training style to approach in regulation. Yet some fields would still get benefits of their degree.\n\nIn conclusion, any student with international degree will have high probability to get a job, in compare to other individual. In my opinion, every individual have their own perspective in education, but foreign university with wide range in academic programs can outweigh disadvantages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ra ca uu va nhuoc diem cua viec du hoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, traffic congestion, and water pollution. Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodations to restrict today’s tourism industry?\"\nEssay:\n\"it is common knowledge that tourism today creates numerous problems, such as pollution because of flights, traffic congestion, and water pollution. From my point of view there is no need to impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation.\n\non the one hand there is no denying fact that extra taxes on flights or accommodation will decrease tourism. definitely there are many individuals who are not wealthy and they save money for going and exploring new countries, however, there is no guarantee that it can be helpful, for instance one of my friends is not rich and at that time he had to go to another country but unfortunately the price for tickets were higher than it used to be and what is more accommodation was not cheap either, but he had no choice, therefore,therefore he paid for all of it, consequently if there is a desire or there is a necessity now matter how much will a person has to pay he will do it eventually\n\non the other hand, if governments impose extra taxes many humans will lose their interest, or if there is no necessity they will not spend a huge amount of money only on travelling, ,however it will not solve problems with pollution. for example pollution is not done by only tourism, many residents pollute our society they throw away their garbage in water or in the streets. Additionally many countries's economies are rich due to tourism, and if one-day people stop going to other countries those countries sooner or later will have many issues.\n\nin conclusion, in my opinion governments should not impose extra taxes because it will cause more problems than now there are\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da phan nao tra loi duoc cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Women can do everything that men can and they even do it better. They also can do many things that men cannot. But it is a fact that their work is not appreciated as much as men's, although they have to sacrififice a lot for their family and career. It is said: \"A woman's place is in the home.\" What do you think?\"\nEssay:\n\"Although in recent time, a lot of people is ignoring women's talent and skills. However, they have even better skills and dedication than men and it can happen only in the women's case of sacrificing their career for the wellbeing of the family because of the conventional thoughts about women. I personally disagree with the viewpoint that women's only job is to being home. \n\nTo start with, if we erase the traditional past ideas and perceptions about women, we can understand that women has better skills than men and in any sectors of life they can perform and shine even better than men. Nonetheless, their skills and hardworks often remain unrecognizable because it is hardly accepted and appreciated by their male counterparts. Therefore, women sometimes feel less motivated and even reluctant to persue their career and explore their talent. Mostly in the rural area for example, women confine themselves in the four walls of home and do not want to participate in the society and economy.\n\nHowever, women's achievement are very rarely celebrated by men because the patriarchal society always posseses a dominating attitudes towards women and they know very well that if women have a plenty of opportunities, they can also be their better partner not only in real life but also in the society.  Hence, they ignore their capabilities and try to demotivate them. \n\nIn conclusion, we can come to the point that, we should not ignore the capability and interests of women to make them a better and skilled partner in the society.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban chu yeu tap trung vao phan bien y kien \"vi tri cua phu nu chi o nha\" va khang dinh rang phu nu co kha nang va diem manh trong nhieu linh vuc va cong viec, va cong viec cua phu nu khong chi o nha ma con co the dat thanh cong trong xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"currently there is a trend towards the use o alternative medicine. However, at best these mothods are ineffective, and at worst they may be dangerous.\n\nTo what extent do you agree with this statement?\"\nEssay:\n\"The economy of most countries is based on the medical industry. Pharmaceutical communities and the medical industry  will always accompany our societies. Although, the latest years a huge development occurs in different methods such as pills made from plants and herbs, and some new physical techniques used by alternative doctors.\n\nFirstly, I strongly believe, that alternative methods may be better for human health, as they give you solutions with no artificial techniques. In addition, not all illnesses can disappear through these different processes. \n\nSecondly, pharmaceutical labs and medicine communities, don't give access to pills or schemes that can be helpful, and as a result, people die from various types of cancer. I know that in Switzerland there is a place for alternative methods against various types of cancer. So, people can apply for therapy, but the cost is very high and insurance companies and governments don't give help. Also, you have to stay there, for two or three months, and this will be repeated every year, until the end. \n\nI strongly believe that alternative medicine must use carefully, and if there is a choice of making a combination with subsisting one, to give better results. \n\nHowever, doctors, biologists, chemistries and pharmaceutical industries have to take advantage of each two issues and make a step forward for something that will give new fordable opportunities for everyone’s health.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTren mat bang chung, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va neu ra y kien ca nhan cua ban ve phuong phap y te thay the.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The older people who need employment have to compete with younger ones. What problems can this create? What are some solutions?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent years, competition is increasing between young people and the old who are searching for same job. It causes some negative consequences and steps should be taken to tackle this problem.\n\nThere are some problems occur when the young and old are struggling to get the job. First of all, elderly people are not very adaptive and creative as youngers are and they do not very energetic to do work like younger. They may find some difficulties with usage of technology and to fulfill the requirements of company which could affect on their health and they might suffer both physically and psychologically. Older people have more difficulties to find a job even when they have same qualifications as younger and have experience also. While, some employers prefer older people with higher working experience rather than younger who have just graduated and having no work experience and good communication skills.\n\nTo solve this problem government should take some initiative in effective way. Government should encourages self-employment for fresh graduates so they can create job opportunities themselves. Then the retirement age should be decreased which reduce the pressure of competition the young have to face. Another possible way is to allocate more money to pension system because who find their pension sufficient for a living will not have to find a work. Moreover, younger people and government should support older person to use new technologies so they can do work well.\n\nIn conclusion, some problems occur in competition of youth and old to get job like technology and experience related but it can be solved by taking some measures like decrease retirement age and increase pension.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nNhiem vu cua bai viet cua ban la neu ra cac van de ma su canh tranh giua nguoi gia va nguoi tre trong viec tim kiem viec lam co the gay ra va de xuat mot so giai phap de giai quyet van de nay.

In the following essay, I will discuss what may contribute to this phenomenon and how people gain information about it.\n\nTo begin with, there are several factors that have responsibility for the society’s increasing interests in the history of the buildings where they live in. Firstly, house plays an important role in maintaining us keeping away from dangerous, in other words, house ensures our safety. As a result, it is of importance for individuals to understand that what had happened in the past before they choose the house or flat that they are going to live in. Secondly, with the knowledge of their houses and buildings, it is possible to make the residents to be proud of their community and become willing to participate in public decision, and enhance a sense of community.\n\nAs for the ways to gain an insight into the research, the elderly and the Internet are the two main resources to get information. From the aspect of the old, they have experienced a lot of experiences, and also have a possibility to suffer from some accidents that happened several years ago. If people want to acquire the first information about the house, building or accommodation, having an interview with elderly is a good manner. Searching on the Internet is another way to learn about the history, and it is also an efficient way.\n\n\tIn conclusion, knowing the history of our houses or buildings enables us to enforce the sense of community, furthermore, it can help the society to be more careful to make a choice before buying houses, flats or departments.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den cac ly do khien moi nguoi quan tam den lich su ngoi nha ma ho song.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people decide to start their own busniess instead of working hour for a company or organization. Do the advantages for people working for their own business outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the majority of individuals are inspired to be self-employed rather than being an employee in either a company or organization. I personally believe the benefits such as flexible working hours and opportunity to earn much more profit far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\n\nTo begin with, there is a plethora of advantages of being a self-employed businessman. Despite some struggles at the beginning, the start-uppers may become successful and create job opportunities for other people. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on work depends on willingness of the boss. Whether they work hard and long, and consequently earn lots of money, or they might shorten their working hours and as a result reduce their income, whereas in large companies, people only have an hourly salary, and it does not matter, whether they do their best at work or have worked extra, they will have the appointed salary. Moreover, there  are some people who can not work under someone's control, they want to have financial freedom and become independent, working on theirselves.\n\nOn the negative side, the self-employed individuals may face some difficulties at the real beginning of developing their business. Although, the bosses need to work extra in order to become successful at the opening stage of their business, however as their companies grow, the risks of losing everything might cause health problems for individuals. For instance, the recent investigation has demonstrated that, 9 out of ten companies become bankrupt in the first five-year period. Apart from this, people working for themselves can not enjoy all the perks and facilities, which are provided in world-scale companies, such as Amazon or Apple, which provide their employees with bonuses, paid vacations, health insurance and etc.\n\nIn conclusion, in spite of factors such as creating a successful empire and also, feel relaxed and confident, it is worth to begin a new job, however there are some disadvantages, which I consider as unimportant.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va the hien quan diem cua minh ro rang.

This essay will examine the causes as well as the effects  related to this tendency.\n\nThere are a variety of different causes for this matter . To begin with, the foremost causes of gaining weight are inactive lifestyles and unhealthy leisure activities. Technology is increasingly developing to help people less physically demanding at work. For example, my father after a stressful day at the company,  will relax by surfing Facebook, and YouTube instead of walking and exercising Another contributing factor to mention is using fast food in place of a main meal. These foods are prone to bacterial contamination, and contain a lot of preservatives. For example, if we eat too much fast food, a large amount of fat and preservation are absobe into the body causing diseases\n\nUnexpectedly, there are some to be taken into consideration.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is important for children to learn the diffrence between right and wrong ar an early age. Punishment is necessary to help them learn this distinction.\n\nTo what wxtent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.\n\nwhat sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behavior to children\"\nEssay:\n\"It is essential for toddlers and kids to learn the difference to what is acceptable and what it is not at early age. Some people believe that given them a punishment is vital to help them to grow and learn the difference. I strongly agree with this mentallity because children will become adults and need to follow society's rules and parents and teachers should remove toys or phones that children love to punish them to allow them learn good behaviour.\n\nChildren need to learn the difference between right and wrong at very early age because they will become adults who need to follow society's rules. Firstly, when children learn at early age that means  not following rules, this will led them to no valuable items such as toys, cellphones or watchin TV. As result, they learn the importance of following parent's rules. Also, they experience what means to be rejected by parents or teachers because they did not follow instructions, so these type of behaviour is similar with adult's rules. Foe instance, in The United Statesm if people do not follow trafic rules, they might get a ticket and need to pay a fine, and if they do not pay the bill, they might go to prison.\n\nParents and teachers should punish children when they do not follow instructions, and one way is to removing valuable itmes such as cellpones or not having the privilige to watch a TV program. To begin with, learning the importance of follow directions at early age, allow them to think the difference of not be part of a system. However when children do not follow direccions, they need to suffer some consequences like going to bed without dessert, so they might feel pain for not enjoy life like the rest of the children. To illustrate, in most countries, parents punish their children by giving them thinking time when they do not obey at home, and this help children to have time and think for a way to apologize and learn from having a bad behaviour.\n\nTo conclude, it is vital for children to learn what is acceptable or what is not at early age to allow them to learn how human beings behave in a society because later on these children will be adults as well. More importantly, parents and teachers should help to disciplinate these kids at home and at schools, so they can have a better understanding of the importance of beahave well. If children are not punish at early age, they migh encounter difficult to adapt to society.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the houses or buildings they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is a growing number of people who start to care about the history of their houses, flats or apartments in numerous nations nowadays. In the following essay, I will discuss what may contribute to this phenomenon and how people gain information about it.\n\nTo begin with, there are several factors that are responsible for society's increasing interest in the history of the buildings where they live. Firstly, the house plays an important role in keeping us away from danger, in other words, the house ensures our safety. As a result, it is of importance for individuals to understand what has happened in the past before they choose the house or flat that they are going to live in. Secondly, with the knowledge of their houses and buildings, it is possible to make residents proud of their community and become willing to participate in public decisions, and enhance a sense of community.\n\nAs for the ways to gain an insight into research, the elderly and the Internet are the two main resources to get information. From the aspect of the old, they have experienced a lot of experiences, and also have a possibility to suffer from some accidents that happened several years ago. If people want to acquire the first information about the house, building or accommodation, having an interview with the elderly is good manners. Searching the Internet is another way to learn about history, and it is also an efficient way.\n\nIn conclusion, knowing the history of our houses or buildings enables us to enforce a sense of community. Furthermore, it can help society to be more careful to make a choice before buying houses, flats or departments.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den cac nguyen nhan va cach thuc nghien cuu lich su cua ngoi nha.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that everyone has the right to have access to university education, and that governments should make it free for all students no matter what financial background they have. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, especially in a knowledge-based society, the acquisition of a tertiary degree plays a vital role in finding good jobs so some people think that universal university education should be implemented, besides the government should cover higher education tuition of students regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds. In my opinion, I believe that these changes can bring a number of advantages ; however, their drawbacks are more significant.\n\nIt is acknowledged that the availability of tertiary education without tuition fees can have several positive impacts on  individuals and society. This is because thanks to such education available, more people have the opportunity to study specialized knowledge, thus they probably enhance their lives with a tertiary degree to get a job with a high salary and it also contributesto  a more educated workforce to countries. Moreover, the provision of free-of-charge education could create a balanced opportunity for all students, especially for poor students who cannot afford to study at university due to prohibitively expensive tuition fees. As a result, these changes may improve the country's economy and bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nHowever, this line of reasoning is flawed because of the long-term dire consequence on the country’s development of these changes. To be specific, everyone entitled to university will reduce the competition among individuals so it will make them less motivated to try and improve their academic ability to pursue university education.Besides, the free-college policy can cause students who study at university lose the motivation to study hard. Consequently, the bachelor’s degree will lose its value and even the quality of education in university can be affected significantly, resulting in a reduction in the ability of the workforce which has a key role in the development of a country . In addition, the part of the budget allocated to other aspects such as the transport system, economy and health system will be spent on education, leading to tax hikes and social welfare reduction, meaning the standard of living of residents will be affected.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the government should not implement the availability of tertiary education without tuition fees because of its risks.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da chinh xac tra loi cau hoi de bai ve quan diem cua ban ve viec tat ca moi nguoi co quyen truy cap giao duc dai hoc va chinh phu co nen cung cap giao duc dai hoc mien phi cho tat ca hoc sinh hay khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some pepole say that teenagers should work part-time and earn money. This way they will learn basic lessons about work and becom disciplined. Others argue that teenagers should not sacrifice their rest and after-school activities to work .\n\nDiscusee both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent conditions, there are two different arguments about the young generation. The first argument is the young generation should work part-time and earn money, so they can learn new knowledge from that. And the other view is that teenagers should focus on their school. These two perspectives have  advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe teenagers who work part-time will get new experiences that will improve their abilities and knowledge. They will respect the value of money and will become disciplined. Otherwise, it can make the young generation can not focus on their school. They feel tired with their part-time and then at their school they only sleep. From this view, teenagers can not enjoy their school activities.\n\nMaybe the student will lose their life at their school.\n\nThe other perspective is about the student must focus on their school activities. They can learn a lot from their lecturer. Many college do not permit their student to work part-time because they want their student to focus on their curriculum. This view may be a warning because the student will only get a theory of life not the practical.\n\n The student also needs the practical for their sustained life.\n\nIn my opinion, we can combine the two perspectives. The young generation sometimes gets to know the part-time at the season and then focus on their school. So it will be balanced in their life.\n\nWe can conclude that perspective about the activity the teenager was debatable but they can be combined to complete each other\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dua ra ca hai quan diem: mot la cac thieu nien nen lam viec ban thoi gian va kiem tien de hoc nhung bai hoc can ban ve cong viec va tro nen ky luat, va hai la cac thieu nien khong nen hy sinh thoi gian nghi ngoi va hoat dong sau gio hoc de lam viec.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"it is generally believed that some people are born with certain talents for instance for sports or music and others not.Discuss both view and your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Some believe talent is the priority for success, but others believe talent does not play a role in success. Also, education and perseverance are more important than that. I agree with both groups.\n\nAll human beings are born with different talents, which can be said that a large part of them is transmitted through genetics, but it cannot be said that it includes all cases. Many talents of every human being are unknown and should be known through experience in different fields. If you know your talents, you can quickly develop them and be more creative.\n\nOthers believe in the beneficial effect of education. If you do not have any knowledge or talent in various fields such as music or art, with regular effort and good and educated teachers, you have a greater chance of success. Although trying can be much more challenging, its effect is more permanent. Frequent and regular effort can be much better than empty talent because you know and strengthen your weaknesses with practice.\n\nIn short, talent plays a significant role as long as you know them. The following condition is attractive, automatically making you practice or develop yourself, and these three things will lead to progress. Like Homayoun Shajarian, who, in addition to his talent and interest in music, his father's teachings and other teachers made him practice for years, and finally, after many years, he released his album and surprised everyone.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi cau hoi dung.

As a result they will in a good understanding level in every course core. for example, In ,China they commit  young children to learn English language. As a result about 90 per cent of Chinese able to speak English fluently. moreover, this is a kind of merit, because major  occupation seeking for employee who speaks English language.\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion, I reckon all subjects must be obligatory as  It is really significant to commit the young pupil to explore all subjects initially. then, when he grows he will find the real course he wants to engage. more over obligated subjects are beneficial but in the future. since the young person doesn't has sufficient experience to choose what is  best for him.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCac yeu to Task Response trong bai viet cua ban chua duoc the hien mot cach day du va hieu qua.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people prefer one-on-one lessons, while others prefer groups. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"According to some folks, private lessons are more efficient; however, a group of people think that public tutoring is more beneficial. This essay will elaborate on both views and my opinion favoring the latter proposition.\n\nOn the one hand, individuals choose personal classes for an array of reasons. The first and foremost key reason is that they better understand any topic or subject. It is due to their comfort level with asking any questions they have. They do not feel comfortable and are rather shy to ask their teachers to repeat a lesson if they do not get a proper idea about that topic when other students are there because they think those people will make fun of them for a silly question. They are not bothered by this type of problem if they enroll in private classes; therefore, they can ask multiple times, and by doing this, they will have an in-depth understanding of the lesson, which will help them during their exams in achieving higher grades. For instance, it is observed that the toppers who have secured higher ranks had private classes to prepare for their examinations. Moreover, it is undoubtedly true that personal coaches can appropriately train their learners. They can focus individually and perfectly, even on simple methods, since they have more time to guide them. Most parents, for instance, choose private sports trainers for their kids to make sure about the decent personal techniques provided by the trainers.\n\nOn the other hand, some hold a view that group training has adequate merits for various reasons. Firstly, they will get a chance to learn from the other’s doubts. In simple words, if a number of trainees are involved in coaching, there are chances of several queries from individuals, and to solve their doubts, an educator will have to go for back-and-forth. Through this activity, all learners will have better knowledge about the topic because of a plethora of revisions. Secondly, it is affordable for most people. It is undoubtedly true that public tutorials charge less than private ones, and hence most guardians of juveniles who have low income can afford them. Thirdly, it can improve the basic skills of group class takers. To put it simply, one can have abundant chances to communicate with fellow members, and also they can help each other to clear their doubts. By doing this, they will have the skill of teamwork, which will help them in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion to the aforementioned statements, it can be stated that both views have some merits; however, in my opinion, people should select the group classes because it is more advantaegous than the private classes.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai bang cach thao luan ve ca hai quan diem, ve viec hoc ca nhan va hoc nhom.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries, schools have severe problems with student behavior. What do you think are the causes of this What solutions can you suggest\"\nEssay:\n\"In many nations, school struggle with serious issues regarding misbehaviour of pupils. In my opinion, there are several reasons why indiscipline behaviour increase among students including, overcrowded classrooms in school, violence on the social media, however, there some measures to tackle this issue namely, build more school, banned violence in social media. \n\nOn the one hand, the primary reason for misbehaviour of students is crowded on classrooms in the school. This is because teachers face challenges to maintain discipline among of children reuslt of increase the number of students in the classrooms. For example, in some school in Saudi Arabia teachers teach over 50 students , which means teachers unable to deal with a huge number of students. Violence in the social media is another reason why unacceptable behaviour increase among students. This is due to the face that, children watch  violent images on social media platform namely, Facebook, and  Twitter. Therefore, children will copy what they see on the social media and  apply it on the classrooms on school. \n\nOn the other hand, there are many actions can taken by the government to addressing this problem. The first effective measure, the government should provide more funding for education sector  in order to build more school, which this step can contribute to reduce the number of students on classrooms. As a result, it  will become more easy for teachers to maintain  discipline among pupils. Prohibited violent images on social media is another efficient measure to mitigate misbehaviour of pupils. For instance, the government should introduce harsh laws to banned violent images on social media.\n\nTo sum up, From my perspective , there are different  reasons why school suffer from unacceptable behaviour among pupils namely , overcrowded classrooms in school, violent images on the social media, however, there some solutions to cope with  this problem  like , build more school, Prohibited images violence in social media.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach xac dinh cac nguyen nhan dan den hanh vi khong phu hop cua hoc sinh va de xuat cac giai phap de khac phuc van de nay.\n\nTuy nhien, de nang cao diem so, ban co the:\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that the best way to reduce the crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others ,however,believe there are better alternative ways of reducing crime. Discuss both views\"\nEssay:\n\"In the last decade the number of crimes has increased fiercely together with the punishments for different atrocities.This essay will focus on evaluating peoples’ views on this topic.\n\n   It is often said that lawbreakers tend to commit crimes inasmuch as they are not utterly punished,without taking in the consideration the surroundings.Moreover,it is not a secret that a large number of delinquents,offenders, end up in the prison because of breaking the law subsequently  they get arrested.Besides,some of them committed felonies,such as homicides,sexual assault,terrorism,animal cruelty,kidnapping ,so they must be imprisoned for a long time and hence in extreme poor conditions.In this way,the criminals can not present any danger to the society,consequently the crime rate is expected to decrease.\n\n  Notwithstanding the aspects and deep controversial opinions,the history shows us some techniques of dealing with criminals;for instance,in Eastern Europe ,people accused of crime would be sentenced to death by such means as burning alive,drowning,beating to death.In this particular way,they could not present any danger to the society.Although, this type of punishment was abolished in 1983, a great part of volunteers,writers,citizens around the world are currently thinking about the idea of bringing back death penalty.Not only does it provide a definite way to prevent crimes and keep the world a safe place,but it also leads to an economical growth for the country,since the offenders  are fed from  the state budget together with the medical care and other supplies provided.Conversely ,some people are seldom imprisoned for a crime they didn’t commit ,as a result,they are prone to capital punishment regardless their innocence.\n\n   To sum up the message of the essay,people take different looks towards particular situations;therefore ,it is better to prevent than to fight against.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dua ra quan diem rang tang an tu dai han la cach tot nhat de giam toi pham.

I totally disagree with this given statement and this essay shall shed light upon my perspective in the subsequent paragraphs along with a reasoned conclusion. \n\nForemost, the fundamental reason behind my disagreement is that nowadays, the majority of people prefer to travel by aeroplane as it saves time for travelling, so it is important for each and every person because they may spend their time on other essential work. For instance, a survey conducted by Harward University revealed that around the globe air travelling is popular among the population as it takes less time to reach any particular place than other transportation. \n\nBesides this, growth in the economy of nations. If people travel by aeroplane to the foreign countries for explore the different types of locations, the region may earn huge amounts of capital where people would prefer to go there. Fie example, an article published by The Tribune newspaper showed that Thailand is developing their country with the assistance of air travelling as there are more tourist spots available.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Big salary is much more important than job satisfaction.\n\nDo you agree or disagree?\n\nProvide relevant examples if necessary.\"\nEssay:\n\"A great number of us believe that a huge, tempting salary is more valuable than being content with our jobs. Indeed, the special time of enjoyment and contentment is when we spend our stacks of cash extravagantly during the holidays. The vast majority does not think for a second that jobs could make them happy. Generations of workers have their minds programmed to bear one thought; that you either have financial welfare or satisfaction with your occupation. Be that as it may, I completely disagree with this common view. One should certainly be enjoying their work, which should simultaneously be their passion. The following paragraphs will explore my personal perspective.\n\nIt is undeniable that stability is ensured once an adult secures a position in a high-paying corporation. Precisely, the basic office job which pays the bills, keeps the children’s tummies full, and affords good education. However, why would an individual follow a career path predetermined for them, in which their success has a definite limit? Moreover, most workers are depressed by how they spend their 9 AM-5 PM hours, but are brainwashed into believing it is the best way. In such a scenario, we must take a step back, and question what makes life worth living. A huge portion of one’s week lacks any hint of joy, and that is a conscious choice on their part. While those 40 hours are naturally filled with hard work, one is free to choose whether it is for a desk job for a company that does not care about employees, or for a passion.\n\nFurthermore, large companies justify cruel treatment to their employees due to the amount of money they are paid. The most important lesson I have learnt in my lifetime is that no amount of cash can buy dignity. Thus, everyone should be treated with the utmost respect and consideration. In addition to that, when you have motivation and drive to achieve your dream occupation, you are more likely to. Certainly, you will not be glowing with determination in a position you dislike. Thus, once you do succeed in your preferred path, you kill two birds with one stone. On top of that, remember that life is not worth living without bliss. The fear to dismiss a conventional method is prevalent among society. Nonetheless, anyone brave enough to contradict the rules never regrets it.\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that conventional ways guarantee basic life needs and some other things every now and then. Nevertheless, no individual should be held captive by a corporation that redeems them as expendable. Turning your fantasies to reality require resilience and patience, but it is worth it. Thereafter, colors become vibrant as they once were in childhood. Ultimately, I disagree with the perspective of the majority. Bliss is undoubtedly of more value than income.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung cau hoi de bai voi quan diem ro rang rang job satisfaction (su hai long voi cong viec) quan trong hon luong lon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries students are engaged in some sort of paid work . Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it as valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities. What is your opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"The task at hand is asking you to give an opinion on the question if students should part-take in paid work. Working for money is the wrong approach in some people's eyes, whereas it's crucial for learning and taking responsibility for others. Personally, I strongly agree with the latter and think it is very valuable. It gives you a better understanding of the reality in the workplace, as well as helping you to immediately apply theoretical concepts in practice and learn from the experience.\n\nFirstly, working while studying gives you great insight that you cannot always deliver work of perfect quality and that you sometimes have to take shortcuts. I've also seen this at my workplace a lot of times. There were strict deadlines set up and we had to descope work in order to hit the delivery date. Coming back to the question, this is important learning and teaches you about taking responsibility.\n\nIn addition, it fosters you to apply theoretical concepts learned in university to real-life work situations. This case happens a lot to me, since I am working three days a week next to my studies.\n\nUsually, I am able to use programming design patterns, which I practised in school, in a much larger codebase at work. Connecting to the question, doing paid work helps me to increase my understanding of concepts and pushes me to learn more.\n\nTo conclude, my opinion on the topic is that I value getting paid for work very much. This is mostly due to the reason that it helps me to understand the work-life better and it allows me to immediately try out the concepts learned in school, which further strengthens my understanding.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response trong bai viet cua ban can duoc cai thien.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Over the last few years, there has been a dramatic increase in the price of energy for a variety of reasons. This has caused many people to be affected by \"fuel poverty\". Outline the situation and problem of fuel poverty. Then find\n\nsome solutions to improve the problem and evaluate these solutions.\"\nEssay:\n\"Several factors have contributed to the substantial rise in energy prices over the past few years. Many people are now experiencing \"fuel poverty\" as a result of this. According to Jones, (2023) Being unable to spend enough money to heat your home sufficiently is known as fuel poverty. Low income, high fuel prices, and inefficient energy use are the root causes. \n\nİt is known that living in cold and damp places has some problems. Firstly, the problem is without Insulation homes, In a study by Lynos (2023), a home with a lack of insulation can cost €1,368 more to heat annually than a home with enough insulation.  Secondly, The main factor behind rising energy bills is the rising cost of polluting forms of energy like gas and oil. Thirdly, people need fair pricing for fuel. According to, Nickless (2023) the price of energy decreases as you consume more of it under the current pricing system. As a result, individuals with the lowest earnings pay the highest energy costs since they consume the least, while the rest of us pay the bill for the rich's expensive lifestyle.\n\nOverall, the first possible solution, The £360 increase in the typical energy bill over the past ten years was mainly due to the increased cost of gas. The only option to permanently reduce costs is to quickly switch from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy produced by the sun, wind, and waves. The second possible solution is using a fair pricing system, According to Nickless (2023), this would lower the costs of supplying the essential energy needed for cooking, heating, and lighting while also acknowledging that these needs ought to be treated as human rights. Thirdly, According to Winser (2023), artificial intelligence can now be an essential tool in the struggle against fuel poverty. The project uses modern Al software to combine data from several sources. This data is displayed in a simple way that highlights which houses in London and the southeast of England could require more help. Last but not least, To assist minimize energy waste and reduce costs, the government ought to sponsor a street-by-street insulation program.\n\nTo conclude, Sandiford and McRae (2023) estimate that 8.4 million people will be living in fuel poverty by the time costs rise in April 2023, a rise from the charity National Energy Action's (NEA) current estimate of 6.7 million.  There are a lot of people who are suffering and the biggest help should come from governments. According to Lynos (2023), Nobody ought to be forced to decide between heating their home and putting food on the table. This should also involve help from the government for those in need.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCac y tuong trong bai viet cua ban dap ung tot yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones. \n\nWhy is this the case?\n\nIs this a positive or a negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this day and age, smartphones have become a vital part of modern life, and a growing number of young people are sacrificing daily hours for using ones to serve for their entertainment and studying demands. From my perspective, this trend has some potential detrimental impacts on children. \n\nThere are immense reasons for the phenomenon. Firstly, a large number of functions and applications are integrated into the cell phones. Young individuals with curiosity by nature, they are easily attracted by simulation games, renewable functions and some similar ones. In addition, the growing dominance of social networks is one of the reasons leading to a long concentration span of children on the mobiles. To illustrate, a wide range of entertaining and studying resources make children willing to spend a long time discovering and updating the latest information and knowledge. For example, Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms in Vietnam, where everyone can access any given subject or even keep contact with their friends in a far-off distance. \n\nThere are some adverse effects which are accompanied by the phenomenon. First of all, a numerous number of young generations lack interpersonal skills, especially communication skills. This is because they spend too much time in the virtual world and just talk with others via texting instead of verbal communication. For instance, if a youngster gets accustomed to communicating by texting, he will struggle to talk with his friends in real-world conversation. Secondly, children’s physical health can be threatened because of a lack of outdoor activities. The young immerse in virtual video games inside the cell phones, they sacrifice invitations of physical activities with their friends, parents and other people. Gradually, a sedentary lifestyle is established, which may result in obesity of the young generation.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that children have a vast number of reasons to use the smartphone, however I firmly hold the view that excessive reliance can lead to some negative effects.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve nguyen nhan cac tre em danh nhieu thoi gian cho viec su dung dien thoai di dong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In spite I the advances made in agriculture many people around the world still go hungry \n\nWhy is this the case?\n\nWhat Can be done about this poblem?\"\nEssay:\n\"One common area of debate among authorities is the extent of starvation on the majority of the world’s lands despite increasing developments in agriculture fields .I am of the opinion that locating an improper geographical situation on the earth and having inefficient governments can pave the way to this statement which is likely to control if governments be forced through international organizations to use new technologies and more investments in order to better cultivation .\n\nWith increasing technology and new methods in farming like manipulating genes so as to cultivate of fruits and other crops, there are also a few countries that go hungry. There could be divergent factors leading communities to starvation. Firstly,natural disasters can lessen fertilization of the soil, thereby reducing harvest.For example, the main issues that most of  Africa’s regions are dealing with are likely to be drought and lack of water supplies.This causes challenges for farming and harvesting productively.Secondly,despite proper agricultural fields,some political measurements like war or lack of policies in order to use tech and financing through agricultural sectors can pave the path toward poverty.\n\nThere are some strategies to wrestle with these challenges.From my personal perspective, global Institutions like UNICEF or WHO could enforce quite laws in order to make methods of new-tech agriculture mandatory.Countries like Russia or Iran  have investments through political issues rather than other vital sectors like farming  which result in increasing poverty inside society and fewer crops to cultivate or in markers. Moreover, if authorities use new industrial methods like lab-agriculture and make funding through this way ,even in devastating floods or droughts in which crops fail,production is continuing.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, Task Response da duoc dap ung mot cach tuong doi tot.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that children should be banned from using their phones during the school day. Others believe that children should be allowed to use their phones. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"There are many reasons why several schools allowed pupils bring their phones during learning activities. Although children might lose focus in classrooms, I believe that they allowed to bring their phones due to safety aspect.  \n\nOn the one hand, in learning schemes, phones make kids easily distracted as they contain games that addictive. Moreover, children nowadays very excel in accessing information and in operating their smart phones. It could hindering them in not only giving attention to their teachers, but also doing something inapproproate. In addition, kids do not have sense of responsibility and good emotional management. To illustrate, there is a pupil who record a teacher while teaching and it went viral on social media, it really against teacher rights by sharing their privacy. Furthermore, it could be argues that forbiding children to use phones in school environment could lighten teacher’s job. \n\nOn the other hand, allowing kids to bring phones to schools has, therefore, been implemented as a policy that would help teachers’ workforce. If kids using their phones in schools, it would be easy for them to communicate with their parents. Nowadays, there are many criminal activities targeting pupils, and indeed the parents are worried concerning this issue. The majority of schools in Asia, for instance, support children to bring their phone, even though they did not agree with that in the first place. The reason of that is the parents there gather to pushed and argued the schools due to childrens’ safety. Consequently, the schools agree as it could prevent any crimes that might happen to pupils. \n\nIn conclusion, while phones could make students distracted, it enables them to contact their family regarding to their condition and position. I share the same opinion with that as schools unable ensuring students’ safety.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response trong bai viet cua ban tuong doi dat yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Studies suggest that many teenagers these days prefer socialising online to meeting one another in person. Why do you think this is the case? What measures could be taken to encourage teenagers to spend more time meeting one another in person?\"\nEssay:\n\"An increasing number of people today opt to socialise online instead of meeting in person. Thirtfs choice has drawbacks, and there are several ways to encourage adolescents to socialise offline, which will be discussed in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, some of the most common reasons for teenagers communicating online are the convenience and time it might provide, which are unlimited. Unlike meeting offline, which requires them to spend not only their time, but also their energy, they need a lot of preparation to meet someone, whereas communicating in social media only need their fingers and they can deliver their feelings as quickly as they can.  That means that adolescents nowadays do not have more experiences meeting people as they did not want to try something outside their comfort zone, which could potentially decrease their life skills. Consequently, they did not have a well-prepared strategy due to interact with people older than them or important people who will help them in the future. \n\nDespite the obvious demerits, there are two strategies in terms of promoting social skills in adolescence. The first is by strengthen the communities. Society ought to provide an entertaining and supporting place concerning something they love, for instance, a well-known muscisian, series genre, until a book club. Secondly, social communities could hold volunteer projects. Unlike the previous reason, this one will touch their heart and move to help others. If they see an advertisement that contain poor conditions, they will do something and be productive. Moreover, they will give something based on their passion, which can thus increase their social skills to another level.  \n\nIn conclusion, while technological advancement has played a pivotal role in the way teenagers interact with each other, it will hinder them from having active life skills, including empathy for others. Therefore, I remain firmly convinced that the drawbacks could be tackled by communities based on hobby and volunteer activities.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that it is the responsibility of governments to take care of the environment, while others believe that it is the responsibility of the citizens. \n\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"As  this is the era of global warming, environmental care is of utmost importance. Today, through this platform, I am given a chance of expressing my thoughts on who should be responsible to look after the environment. There are two schools of thought, one says that the government should be active in taking measures to secure it. On the other hand, the second is linked to the people. According to this,  people should individually be working. \n\nFor the first point, firstly, the official environmental office should keep  issuing relevant measures. Secondly, they should control the smoke coming out of diesel cars. For this, the people running such vehicles should be banned and charged a heavy amount. Thirdly,  fireworks usage should be stopped. Moreover, the top management should be taking care of extra usage of machinery that exhibits smoke and increases air pollution. In addition, dust and maintenance while raining should also be given a considerable amount of attention. \n\nOn the contrary, the second way is associated with every resident. It is their responsibility to do whatever is required in their capacity. Individuals should avoid smoking because it affects seasons badly. Moreover, they should also take care of extra utilization of air-conditioners and vehicles. They may also go to nearby places by walking or cycling. \n\nI believe that it is not possible for one group to clear the environment. It is always a joint effort of both parties that lead to the best outcomes for a nation to protect itself.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da dung la tra loi cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, international tourism is the biggest industry in the world. Unfortunately, it creates tension rather than understanding between people from different cultures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"At present, several countries are concerned about the rapid growth of the tourism industry, which affects anxiety rather than perception from different population's cultures. I disagree with the statement as it has a lot of advantages over its disadvantages because it offers economic growth as well as brings people, culture and customs together.  \n\nThe tourism industry plays a significant role both in developed and developing countries. For example, Firstly, Not only it provides job opportunities to local residents but also it provides revenue to entrepreneurs. Additionally, it can distribute income to households and businesses. Furthermore, it can stimulate the structural microeconomics and lead to efficient macroeconomics. Consequently, that is the reason why international traveling is an important factor to progress and also a wealthy economy in the future. \n\nSecondly, when tourists visited. They helped to promote the domestic culture and also promoted landmarks to attract other countries. In addition, it had an exchange of foreign languages and good culture to local populations and international travelers, encouraging  residents to cherish resources. The government should support the budget or invest in new technology to maintain the environment. Especially, somewhere that has a sensitive area that should be closed in low season is a suitable way to improve the natural ecosystem. Therefore, industrial tourism truly supports sustainable culture. \n\nTo conclude, international tourism is the largest sector in the world and it brings people from different traditions together and also assists between the cultures. Additionally, it is a great way to understand and learn about new traditions across the globe.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da neu quan diem rieng cua minh ve van de nay.

Therefore, it believes that fights between parents and youngsters are an important part of their life, whereas, others have opposite views regarding this statement. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and give my point of view.\n\non the one hand, there are many reasons behind it why parents should keep an eye on their children during teenage. Firstly, at this age, young generations have less experience than their parents. if parents do not stop their children to take a wrong decision, then they may face difficulties in the future.\n\nFor instance, some youngsters take their decision about their education as influenced by their friends or classmates. As a result, in the coming time, they are not able to get marks in their studies, because they do not have an interest in their fields. Secondly, parents have the right to keep an eye on their children.\n\nSo, they can become successful persons in their lives. For example, nowadays, most teenagers spend their time on social media as compared to  their education. As a result, at a later ,age they do not have any skill or degree to get a job in the competitor era. \n\nOn the other hand, It is suggested by people that parents should give freedom to their children. So, they can make their decision according to their choice. Such as decisions regarding choosing their subjects in high school education. Apart from this, it will also help  offspring to become independent and confident individuals. Last but not  least, conflicts only create disburden amongst families. so, they should avoid conflicts and spend quality with each other.\n\nAccording to my point of view, conflicts always create misunderstanding between both parents and children. Therefore, decisions should be made by both parents and youngsters together. In this way, they can both keep away from tension and stress.\n\nTo conclude, even though different people give different statements about conflicts during teenage between parents and young people. Nonetheless, According to my point of ,views conflicts are just a waste of time.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang viec dua ra ca hai quan diem khac nhau ve van de va dua ra quan diem cua rieng ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays,a growing number of people with healt problems are trying alternative medicines and treatments instead of visiting their usual doctor.\n\nDo you think this is a positive or a negative  development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Today, many people with bad health conditions prefer conservative medicines and treatments compared to going to medical doctors to inspect. From my perspective, this situation could create serious issues people's health, for uneducated person who use alternative medicine to treat people can harm themselves and the other because of their a lack of knowledge of medical subjects. Therefore, the improvment of alternative medicine has huge negative effects on patient's lives.\n\nTo begin with, development in medicine has gradually caught on all over the world and many scientists sacrifise their lives to find treatments for some disease which has high-level mortality such as cancer. These professionals have to call for many skills to graduate from medical school. However, look at the other sides, people who use alternative medicine (including herbal medicine, and acupunture) do not have even a certificate. Hence, patients who believe fake doctors endanger their lives.\n\nOn the other hand, there is no evidence about the treatment of alternative medicine. Additionaly, when making a treatment with herbals, mixing some plants could be toxic for human body. If people take this medicine, their bodies might be damaged irreversibily. Moreover, this medical condition may be unfixed by the doctors due to a lack of scientific research.\n\nTo conclude, the main disadvantage of alternative therapies is that it could be a powerful gun with no real doctors. Nonetheless, governments do not try to curb these kinds of people in order to protect their citizens. I hope governments will take action in the activities of reducing used alternative medicine treatment in the future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve viec ngay nay co ngay cang nhieu nguoi tim den phuong phap chua benh thay the thay vi den bac si thong thuong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people sat that parents should encourage their children to take part in organised group activities in their free time. others say that it is important for children to learn how to occupy themselves on their own.\n\nDiscuss both these view and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"A group of people have an opinion that guardians should encourage  their kids to utilise their leisure time by enrolling themselves on social or group activities. While some people has counter argue that it is crucial for children to learn how to occupy themselves in their personal life. I personally believe in the second set of people. Thus, both my view and my inclination will be discussed further in this essay.\n\nThe first set of people has many reasons why parents should encourage their children to participate in  group activities. Mainly, leisure time is a great choice to engross the overall development of  children. Children should develop themself socially too, not only studying will help them to become  good team players and  good human beings  but also to develop that quality in a child parents should tell him to rather become lonely, go outside, make friends or join a club. In this way, children can learn from other children and develop some social norms and reduce their self-centred nature. Still, I do not agree with this set of people.\n\nOn the other side, some people believe that children should occupy themself with their own useful tasks because by doing so they can be more productive. If kids would spend their time studying well or learning some indoor skills such as cooking, reading or playing indoor games with siblings then they can be more personalised rather  be less focused by participating in group activities. In addition, to be personalised children can obey their parents' instructions and can not have bad habits by following peers in a group, which also makes them productive by not wasting their time on unuseful tasks such as gossiping with friends or criticizing  someone. Thus, my inclination with this set of people  is because being more centralized and personalised can help  a child to learn how to value their precious time.\n\nIn conclusion, although being social and being a team player can be learned by participating in a group activity,  making an effort in a personalised development keep children focused and productive.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ra quan diem cua ca hai nhom nguoi va sau do dua ra quan diem cua rieng ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The reason that most individuals are in debt is due to the overuse and irresponsible use of credit cards. Banks should not issue credit cards unless they are completely sure of an individual’s ability to pay back their debts.\n\nTo what extent do you agree with this?\"\nEssay:\n\"Overspending is a current trend nowadays, which can lead to higher debt proportion in the community. Some people believe that banks should apply the strict role of using credit cards. However, credit cards come with many advantages and thus I do not agree with that. In the following, we will deliberate more impressive usage of credit cards. \n\nOne of the most advantages of credits card provide us with a convenient way of transactions and buying. It's a very comfortable and accessible way. However,people misuse this feature and may buy not nesseccary items, which leads individuals to get into a debut. However,responsible spending should be learned and taught to decrease the percentage of overspending instead of strictly issuing of credit cards. Credit cards are very essential ,especially in emergency situations and hence is not practical for banks to limit using them to persons only who are able to clear the debt. Thus, the efficient way to reduce the rate of overuse is learning people to be more realistic when using credit cards. \n\nAdditionally, there are many factors that lead individuals to incur debts such as loans , and unexpected life circumstances such as job loss and medical needs. All of the previous factors can lead individuals to borrow money and fall into heavy debt. Hence, restricting the use of credit cards could not solve the issue of increasing the rate of debt completely. In terms of financial situations, responsible actions and usage is the most useful way to prevent financial strains and falling into heavy debts. Credit cards are a profound way and  more practical than cash usage  hence banks could not stop using credit cards.\n\nTo sum up, credit cards are a very convenient and practical financial tool. Furthermore, it is very essential in emergency situations. Hence, I totally disagree that banks should restrict credit cards to only  responsible individuals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai.

Personally, I completely disagree with this point of view.

Because the internet plays a significant role in our life, we use it for a whole time. Also, the smartphone is very convenient to take, they easily read newspapers online anytime. In addition, if people want to read a book, then they just need to save the books online on their phone.\n\nOn the other hand, new media such as e-books are not suitable for everyone and cannot be ignored. As elderly people lack of ability to understand those products, especially when they do not have a person who stands by for assisting them. In addition, physical papers are more fittable for their lifestyle, because they will not be bothered by complex pages online, and watching the screen too much will also have a harmful effect on their eyes. Moreover, some people who major in design or news media will need to collect magazines or newspapers to help them with their graduation exhibition in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that e-books bring a lot of advantages to people's lives, but they still cannot replace the traditional methods completely, because  it is not easy for elderly people to be familiar  with.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban tra loi dung vao van de chinh cua cau hoi de bai, tuc la lieu trong tuong lai ai cung co the doc moi thu ma khong can mua bao in hoac sach in hay khong.\n\n- Tuy nhien, ban can phat trien y tuong cua minh mot cach ro rang hon va dua ra cac lap luan dang tin cay de minh chung cho quan diem cua minh.\n\n- Trong bai viet cua ban, y kien cua ban tap trung vao viec cho rang sach dien tu khong the thay the hoan toan phuong phap truyen thong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"With the increased global demand in oil and gas, undiscovered areas of the world should be opened up to access more resources. \n\nTo what extent do you agree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern era, there is a huge debate about the demand for oil and gas is increasing day by day. However, the government wants to give access to companies for finding more resources from undiscovered areas. A large group of people think in its favour. While others have the opposite opinion. The upcoming paragraphs will shed light on my personal opinion with a suitable example.\n\nI agree with the statement nowadays, oil and gas are demanding and there are not enough resources to fulfil the requirements in the future. There are numerous reasons why I am in favour of it. The most important reason is the consumption of oil and gas at the top of the list. In other words, all over the world oil and gas is the main thing that uses globally. Moreover, to fulfil future requirements the government should be allowed to open undiscovered areas for searching new resources of oil and gas. It means that with the help of new discoveries, people fulfil their needs in the future. I would like to give a reason to explain my perspective. Further, everything depends on oil and gas to justify my perception, I would like to give an example of a serve which use conducted by Sydney University in 2014. The survey revealed the findings that oil and gas are directly proportional to the inflation.\n\nOn the contrary, some people oppose the above statement for several reasons, because they believe that gas and oil should be replaced with new technologies. In addition, nowadays, many companies are making electric cars to reduce the consumption of oil and gas. Tesla is the biggest company to manufacture electric cars. Furthermore, solar panels have also introduced in the world to fulfil the requirements in lieu of oil and gas.     \n\nTo recapitulate, according to the arguments aforementioned above.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. I think that the responsibility is on both the buyer and the seller as they both deserve a win-win situation.\n\nOn one hand, The consumer wants to get the goods well preserved and with the least packaging possible as it will help him get to the action faster, And also it is safer this way environmentally, For instance, There are so many goods that don't need this much packaging which consumes more time to open and more energy to waste as an example the decorated boxes which consume more materials just for the appearance to be more appealing. The buyer has to be smarter and more practical to avoid this conflict as at the end of the day the consumer only needs the item which is more useful not the more decorated.\n\nOn the other hand, The manufacturers have a point and this decoration will help them in getting more money as the buyer most of the time tends to buy good-looking items regardless of what is the item but still, The seller has this part of responsibility where he has to be more conservative and using less packaging as much as he can.\n\nIn conclusion, The buyer and the consumer have the same responsibility not only towards themselves but also towards the environment as the buyer has to be more practical and so does the seller.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ve ca hai quan diem \"nha san xuat va sieu thi co trach nhiem giam luong dong goi hang hoa\" va \"nguoi tieu dung nen tranh mua hang hoa voi nhieu dong goi\".

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"why is it important to act as a positive role model withint the school\n\nDiscuss the advantages and disadvantages\"\nEssay:\n\"In academic life, it is always increasingly encouraged to behave as a positive role model in order to portray an admirable and amiable figure within the school campus. This movement allows students to enjoy their best learning experiences as well as accumulate multiple vital knowledge to develop their personal growth. This report will indicate all of the reasons to analyze the necessity of being a positive role model at school. \n\nTo begin with, being a good role model encourages every pupil to pick some figures who have exceptional qualities including confidence, assertiveness, leadership and sociality to inherit from them. This course of action can inspire students to gain valuable life lessons in order to educate children about moral and immoral behaviours, and become a responsible, respectful adult who is willing to make enormous contributions to society. For illustration, the majority of students spend 12 years interacting with plenty of individuals within the school campus and learning from people around them. Therefore, their personalities are shaped and modified depending on the people living in their environments, it is undoubtedly possible for them to become an individual with incredible capabilities to lead everyone in the team to tremendous achievements if those people are able to find someone who aligns with their values and beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, being an active role model prevents young demographics in society from following a scandal-ridden path. Negative role model only provides terrible experiences in their school curriculums which is highly severe to shape a useful personality trait. Behaviours like laziness, disrespect and aggressiveness will bring young children down the path of sins and crimes since they are unable to approach the proper education system. Hence, being a positive role model is not only a protection to help them avoid an unwanted future filled with illegal activities but also an opportunity to promote them develop themselves in life, become a leader who is willing to inspire everyone and have a career ladder to reach the peak of their improvements. \n\nIn conclusion, being an active role model is invariably crucial and beneficial not only for themselves but also for a nation on a large scale. This process of modelling allows children to observe their thoughts and have opportunities for  positive reinforcement of learning behaviours.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den loi ich cua viec lam mau muc tich cuc trong truong hoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that teenagers should concentrate on all school subjects. But others believe that teenagers should focus on the subject that they are good at or that thay find the most interesting. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Society is polarized into two groups almost equally that, whether all academic subjects should be taught in schools or, the choice should be given to opt for the subject of interest to adolescents . Although both notions appear to be rational, however, I opine with the former statement that students should learn different subjects due to the fact that it not only expand their horizon but also instils  creativity. In the following paragraphs, we will elaborate on both viewpoints and discuss why I am in favour of the traditional method of studying. \n\nTo begin with, the proponents of the former statement believe that, by studying all subjects, students are able to expand their horizons. In other words, they can explore their interests and diversify their skills and capabilities by engaging themselves in learning different types of studies. For instance, a student learning history and mathematics  is able to expand his knowledge in general, by knowing about  ancient times and, at the same time, applying basic statistical skills in real life while handling finance by learning mathematics. Moreover, in today's rapid job market, companies often hire candidates with multi-skillset. Thus, it is clear  why many are in favour of traditional methods of studying.\n\nAnother school of thought states that  teenagers should concentrate only on the subjects that they are passionate about and keen to learn. This is because of the fact that  there is no feeling of boredom and pressure to study the subjects that they are lacking interest in. Moreover, it is beneficial for their future career goals. For instance, a pupil, who wants to be a painter or a financial advisor, can begin learning the relevant subjects in advance which will be helpful in achieving their career goal. \n\nIn my opinion, educational institutes should follow the traditional method of the school curriculum, that is, to focus on all subjects because youngsters are impulsive and have poor decision-making skills. Learning all subjects enables critical thinking and give them more opportunity to explore their interest of which they might be unaware . \n\nTo recapitulate, although, focusing on the subject of one's choice, make  learning interesting and undoubtedly, helpful in achieving career-related goals, however, learning all subjects expands one's horizon and enables critical thinking and also diversifies their skillsets. I strongly opine that the former argument as the prons are indeed too great.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve viec thao luan ca hai quan diem va dua ra quan diem cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In their advertising, businesses nowadays usually emphasise that their products are new in some way. \n\nWhy is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Advertising is the easiest and most usable way for corporations to promote their products. They can rely on celebrities, or set a positive image without any details of what they are selling. However, the most common way is to show a certain feature which they want to emphasize. In some businesses, there is a new trend to make ads focusing on the new aspects of their items. This might be the basic method to sell things they produce. This essay will explore the reason for this trend and the pros and cons also.\n\nTo begin with, some people think that this trend would be a good chance to be informed about what is new in a certain market. For example, one of my colleagues bought a new cell phone right after she saw the advertisement. Since that advert pronounced the improved camera performance and at that time, she was looking for a resort which can alternate a telescope whenever she went to concerts. This could be a pro of this trend. \n\nOn the other hand, my view on this issue is quite opposite. Advertising usually convinces the community to buy something constantly. As a result, a lot of folks purchase something which are not really necessary. For instance, all society has cell phones so we don't need to purchase another one since they function well enough. However, brand-new aspects in ads always catch people's eyes and appeal consumers to pay for something unnecessary. This is the first and the worst cons. This atmosphere often leads to consumerism and it naturally gives rise to concerns about overused resources. I can take my experience as an example. I bought a new food container a few weeks ago through a SNS promotion. The advert showed the new function that could store vegetables for a longer time than the previous ones. People including me who purchased this commodity would think that it was a good way not to waste food. However, I started to purchase more foods because I had a belief that the containers would keep these foods well. In other words, I rather spent more compared to the past. This is the last cons of this trend. It could produce a tremendous trash problem.\n\nTo sum up, this trend would be useful for some people. However, it generally tends to cause consumerism, resource overuse, and pollution. For these reasons, emphasizing too much on new aspects would be a bad idea.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTren co so tieu chi Task Response, bai viet cua ban da dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the houses or building they live in. \n\nWhat are reasons for this? \n\nHow can people research this?\"\nEssay:\n\"In some parts of the world, it is becoming increasingly popular to know the history of the property that individuals live in. Some homes can be hundreds of years old so the background can be quite relevant to some people. I will be discussing the reasons and how people can research their own home.\n\nOne of the reasons would be to try and establish the true value of the property. Especially from an investment point of view. This is because knowing the value of a home can help potential buyers negotiate with the seller to get a better deal on their new home. For example, if a house was sold for a hundred thousand five years ago, they buyer now has a better idea of the true value. Additionally, it gives them some peace of mind as some homes can be quite expensive. Moreover, it gives them an idea of when they would need to renovate the property, as this is usually a requirement after a certain period of time for most houses and buildings.\n\nThere are a few ways in which a person may be able to find out about the history of a particular building or house. The easiest would be to use the internet and find out as much as they can online. Not to mention, they would also be able to find out about the entire area or region, not only one specific building. Another way would be to ask the real estate agent what they know about the property as they tend to have the most knowledge about the properties they deal with. Lastly, contact their local library and try to find some historic books about the area.\n\nIn conclusion, fraud is becoming a lot more common than people think. Therefore, it is no surprise people are more interested in their homes. As time goes on, it is important that the government regulates ways in which the history of each residential property is open to the public.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ro cac li do tai sao nguoi dan quan tam den lich su ngoi nha minh va cach ho co the tim hieu ve no.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"increasing number of people are choosing cosmetic surgeries. Why do people have operations to change the way they look? Do you think this is a positive or negative development? (Health)\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the number of cosmetic surgeries has increased all around the world. However, the trend was going through it was started by the actors like Micheal Jackon. However, currently, the case has been changed and everyone is thinking and doing alterations in their appearances. This is because all of us want to be pretty and appreciated.\n\nThe individuals appearing in the limelight want to look attractive and gorgeous. Their aim is to get work and therefore, they keep on chasing  different operations. Additionally, these procedures are performed to enhance different facial features such as nose, lips, cheeks, and jawline. Moreover, Some of the methods are also designed to change the shape of the face and tighten the skin. In addition, there are various people who opt for  whitening procedures. Today, a lot of individuals are experiencing without doing proper research. \n\nUnfortunately, these people are unaware of the consequences that could cause damage to their health. There are side effects associated with each method. The outcomes sometimes may lead the person to receive a lifelong disability. It is never advised by any doctor to take a risk but in the current era, a major concern of  health professionals has also changed. Instead of looking for the betterment of people, they are running after money. Moreover, presently, there are a lot of cosmetic hospitals in different areas of the world. This is the duty of staff members  to guide the crowd and only perform the highly important ones such as a brunt face from acid could be cured. \n\nTo sum up, I would strongly disagree to go for cosmetic methods. There are exceptions in which the person has to go for such things but not for the sake of beautification, this is totally wrong. Each individual should keep in mind that once the process is done wrong, you can't go to the previous appearance.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban duoc xem la da tra loi dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that the increasing use of computers and mobile phones for communication has a negative effect on young people’s reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Electronic devices, such as computers and mobile phones, have become an integral part of communication today. However, pessimists argue that the increasing use of them has a detrimental impact on the language abilities of youngsters. Generally, I have the same concern.\n\nMany young people constantly use acronyms when sending messages on their computers or mobile phones for daily information exchange, and there are software and applications to finish their spelling or correct misspelt words or misused grammar usage automatically. As a result, many of them gradually lose the ability to spell the most commonly used words, and the assisted way of writing leads to the inaccurate use of grammar when they have to compose an essay on their own. Therefore, many of them would suffer from the challenges of the lack of writing competence.\n\nAdditionally, indulging in computer and mobile phone chatting is time-consuming, which results in less time for reading. What is worse, daily communication on electronic gadgets is likely to exacerbate the development of short attention spans and gradually lead to a loss of interest in reading. Nowadays, it is not difficult to notice that there are not many youngsters who read for pleasure or have the habit of reading. Thus, their reading interest and competence will be degraded in the long term.\n\nUndoubtedly, there are websites and mobile applications that can improve the literacy skills of the young in a convenient way. For example, dictionary applications are particularly helpful to enlarging lexical resources; e-books can be appealing to young minds who are not attracted to print media. But unfortunately, the young generation now is more inclined to chat with others to expand their social circle than to develop linguistic ability.\n\nOverall, I believe that too much access to computers and mobile phones for the young generation to communicate with each other can indeed exert adverse effects on their capabilities in reading and writing.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai - \"To what extent do you agree or disagree?\" Ban da trinh bay quan diem cua minh rang viec su dung ngay cang tang cua cac thiet bi dien tu co anh huong tieu cuc den ky nang doc va viet cua nguoi tre, va ban da dong y voi quan diem nay.\n\nTuy nhien, trong qua trinh phat trien y tuong, ban co the cai thien bai viet cua minh bang cach mo rong cac y tuong chinh mot cach chi tiet hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Studies suggest that many teenagers these days prefer socialising online to meeting one another in person.\n\nWhy do you think this is the case?\n\nWhat measures could be taken to encourage teenagers to spend more time meeting one another in person?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Because of the expansion of modern technology, most teenagers prefer online meeting rather than compaied their friends face-to-face agreements. In this essay, I am going to discuss reasons behind this obstacle and how communities and authorities can tackle this issue. \n\nTo begin, with the avalibilty of various apps and online services has been encorging adolescents to creating easily zoom meeting. As a result, the Internet assists to erase the geographical bounderies and overcome on the costs of travelling fees. For example, students can meet their friend in video call via messanger or zoom from over the whole world. Furthermore, parents play a critical role in this problem as they give their children no time for themselves to go out and participate in outdoor activities by hardening them with a harch time-tight academic scheduale. In other words, teens spend most of their times contributing in many acadmies and competitions more than taking a break to explore their surrounding and make mamories with their mates.\n\nHowever, the government and communities, including parents, have a crucial role in handling and tightening spreading this sighnificant issue. firstly, authorities need to emply more obligations and restrictions according to age. For instance, applying high fees on the internet services in favour of limiting teenagers access will help to controlling on them as they cannot afford it. secondly, society should increase their awareness with downsides of over-interaction with their relationship online instead of real interactions such as isolation, depression, and health conditions. To illustrate, communities should provide activites, festivals, and public palces to encourging them to gather with their mates and families. Parents also should clear the aim of meeting people face-to-face as human being's relationships rely on body language, facial expresions, and intonation.\n\nIn conclusion,  despite the improvement of digital technology, it is undoubtedly that it has many downsides on teenagers lifestyle, so the community and government should handle these problem by applying a strict laws and increasing their knolwedge about dangers of misusing of the internet.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve viec tai sao nhieu thanh thieu nien thich giao tiep truc tuyen hon gap go mat truc tiep.

That's why it's important for parents to monitor their screen time and limit the hours dedicated to video games,moreover,parents should encourage their children to go outside and play during their leisure time .\n\nIn my opinion, I believe that the advantage outweighs  the disadvantage,nowadays there is useful content on the t,v which could educate them,as for video games , multiple research has proved that playing video games help young children develop coordination skills.\n\nin conclusion, as opposed to the people who believe t.v and other sources of digital entertainment would result in a disadvantage to the growing population, I strongly believe spending time on video games and t,v can only benefit children when they grow up.

Indeed, it is widely known that a bad situation causes unpleasant feelings in the person that experiences it. For instance, a recent study revealed that individuals that avoid getting away from their comfort zones and facing a problem are more prone to experience psychological problems.\n\nAnother point in support of my opinion is that a bad situation includes serious repercussions. Admittedly, when a human being is procrastinated and avoids tackling their difficulties is in a bad mood constitutionally and has mood swings during the day. Therefore, they become isolated and sometimes they commit suicide.\n\nHowever, it is claimed that individuals who choose to remain in a situation that is troublesome are afraid of losing their comfort zone and they live peacefully. Admittedly, it is difficult to get away from the ordinary in order to improve a situation. For example, the majority of people are not succeeding in their life be it in their personal life or career level for the reason that they are not fans of change. Yet this is not entirely true since every start is hard but if a person overcomes a problem automatically feels better than before.\n\nAll things considered, although it is effortless for society to choose the easy path and have a specific routine, I firmly believe that people should be open to challenges and face their problems , only then they do a positive step forward in mankind.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dung pham vi va tra loi dung cau hoi de bai voi ca hai quan diem duoc de cap va quan diem ca nhan cua ban.

In various sectors, we see the importance of these inventions and found them helpful. Undoubtedly, innovation has an impact on relationships and the process of communicating with each other. \n\nIn the ancient period, due to a lack of means of communication, it was hard for people to be in touch with each other. If they are living away from their homes the process to get in touch with their loved ones was very complicated and time-consuming. This drawback of the olden days made a lot of communities suffer and left them to carry tough life.\n\nWhereas on another hand when the latest discoveries are available, it is very much convenient for family, friends, relatives and the known ones to interact with each other. It takes just a matter of seconds to contact a person staying overseas. The reach of technology is improving present day. If you want to send any message to more than one person, it is at your fingertips. Due to these inventions long distance relationships are possible. Studies and official meetings can be seen taking place remotely with the aid of these new ideas. \n\nHowever, some folk say that due to the availability of this easiness people are getting limited to the gadgets themselves.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think the typical teaching of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Technology is progressing at an exponential pace and this makes it very difficult to predict what the schools and the teacher-taught relation of 2050 will be like. However, I do agree with the given statement that the typical teaching of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by 2050.\n\nEducation will be driven by technology and learning will be able to happen anytime and anywhere. Students will also be able to make choices in how they learn the content. Learning will be based on individual interests and need. It will no longer be the ‘one size fits all’ approach. Technology will serve as a means to the resources that students will be able to utilize in order to broaden their learning.\n\nTeachers will become facilitators of knowledge and no longer the only experts because of the rapid and constant changes and additions to information that can be found. For example, the amount of medical knowledge doubles every eight years; it is said that half of what an engineering student learns in their first year is obsolete or revised by the time they graduate. The teacher will still guide students through learning but it will be impossible for teachers to have all the knowledge with technology. That is capable of finding more than can be learned. The teacher will still be needed to help students learn where to locate information and help students evaluate sites and resources for validity.\n\nSpecialists in technology will need to be part of the educational environment to constantly enrich the learning environment for students. Each child will have a portable computer and textbooks will not exist. Teachers will use tablet PCs and projectors to call up images at the front of the classroom at the touch of a button. With the old sound of chalk on a blackboard being replaced by the hum of desktop computers.\n\nTo sum up, I pen down saying that despite all the new technology in 2050. The school would still remain a social occasion and teachers would still be there even if their way of imparting knowledge would be driven by technology.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050.\"\nEssay:\n\"​​It is often said that technological advancements are rapidly changing the way we live, work, and learn. The traditional classroom setting of a teacher instructing a group of students may be considered outdated by the year 2050. While I agree that the role of teachers and students in the classroom may change, I believe that the traditional teaching situation will still exist to some extent.\n\nOn the one hand, technology has already begun to revolutionize the way we learn. Online education, for example, has become increasingly popular and has allowed individuals to access educational resources from anywhere in the world. In addition, virtual classrooms and video conferencing have made it possible for students and teachers to connect and communicate without the need for a physical classroom. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has also impacted the way we learn. These technologies can personalize learning experiences for each individual, allowing students to work at their own pace and receive customized feedback. This has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods and create a more individualized approach to education.\n\nHowever, I do not believe that the typical teaching situation will completely disappear. While technology has its benefits, there are certain aspects of learning that require face-to-face interaction. The physical presence of a teacher in the classroom can be invaluable, as it provides students with the opportunity to ask questions, receive immediate feedback, and engage in group discussions. The classroom environment also promotes socialization and collaboration, which are essential skills for students to develop. Moreover, the traditional teaching situation provides a sense of structure and routine that can be beneficial for students. The physical classroom creates a learning space where students can focus and eliminate distractions. It also establishes a routine for students, which can help them develop good study habits and time management skills.\n\nIn conclusion, while the teaching situation in the year 2050 may be different from what we know today, I believe that the traditional classroom setting will still exist to some extent. While technology may transform the way we learn, the physical presence of a teacher and the classroom environment provide benefits that cannot be replaced by digital tools. Therefore, it is important to embrace technological advancements while also recognizing the value of traditional teaching methods.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"We have three important parts of education: reading, writing and maths. Some people think every child will benefit from a fourth skill added to the list: computer skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent years, it is increasingly popular to be engrossed in technology. While it is unnecessary to force schoolchildren to be into technology according to some, I believe that computer skills put children one step ahead of others. \n\nOn the one hand, we live in an era of technology. Computers make our life easier regardless of place. Technological improvements can vary in their benefits, and it is unavoidable that many workplaces, including government ,offices tend to use technology due to make their job easier and save their running costs. In 2002, the Azerbaijani government announced that all judgements should be passed by e-mail to the executive officers to accomplish. If one of their employees is bad at technology, they can not handle some problems as well as they can not help to drive companies business successfully. \n\nOn the other hand, computer skills will help children for getting a secure job. Many people in our country are not taking the artificial intelligence sector seriously, therefore, their children do not tend to insist on learning computer skills. Today, the demand for AI is increasing rapidly and many foreign companies are willing to pay high sums for these workers, thus children will be better off. In future, robots can replace us and captivate our place in work. In that case, children that are good at technology can get out of this situation and they, probably, find accurate jobs related to their computer skills. Otherwise they can be between jobs and have to cope with financial issues. In South Korea, about 15% of their accountants are robots and the number climb up day-by-day. \n\nIn summary, while some argue that technological skills can be a huge burden for children, I consider that by getting knowledge of computers, children will have a more chance to be well off in future and they can maintain their careers hardly.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da ro rang dua ra y kien cua minh va ho tro no trong cac doan van chinh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many countries, paying for things using mobile phone (cellphone) apps is becoming increasingly common.\n\nDoes this development have more advantages or more disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"In today's modern era, the integration of cell phones into daily life has witnessed a significant rise. While mobile phones offer numerous benefits that enhance convenience, several concerns associated with their usage can harm human health and well-being. However, despite these drawbacks, imagining a life with cell phones is easier. In this essay, I will go into detail about this development's advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe proliferation of cell phones has revolutionized various aspects of life. Firstly, mobile phones provide a plethora of entertainment options. For example, playing video games has attracted many users worldwide, particularly among individuals aged 16 to 35. Additionally, mobile applications enable users to easily access their favourite music, movies, and series while offering customizable playlists. Moreover, cell phones have simplified daily routines by providing convenient solutions. Online shopping has become effortless, with deliveries made directly to desired destinations. Communication has also been greatly facilitated, allowing individuals to send messages and make calls from anywhere. Furthermore, location-finding applications make navigating to desired goals a breeze. However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential harms associated with improper and excessive cell phone usage.\n\nDespite the numerous advantages, integrating cell phones into daily life has specific challenges, as with any technological advancement. One of the critical concerns is the potential for time consumption and addiction, particularly among students who are easily enticed by the various attractions offered by mobile phones. Excessive usage can lead to poor concentration during studies and hinder educational progress. Additionally, unrestricted access to internet content through mobile phones can expose individuals to cultural dissonance. For instance, someone from a community where women are required to wear hijab may come across images that contradict their ethical values, leading to irritation and discomfort. However, these complications can be mitigated to some extent by implementing filters and careful observation.\n\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that cell phones have made life more enjoyable and convenient. Nevertheless, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the social and behavioural issues that arise from their overuse. By considering the potential drawbacks and taking appropriate measures, we can maximize the benefits of cell phones while minimizing their negative impacts on individuals and society as a whole.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

Others deny that these factors have any significant influence on people’s behaviour. What is your opinion?\n\nIn this era, the usage of video games on different types of play stations is increasing day by day. Children enjoy these modern sorts of games with full concentration. Many games are related to violence, like fighting with each other in groups. The effects of these types of games are too dangerous for society. However, fewer people think that these types of games do have not any major effects on an individual’s behaviour. In the following paragraphs, I will explain the reasons and my opinion, about how these types of games destroy  children's lives in our society. \n\nIn the beginning, according to fewer people, children play different sorts of games in different ways. Few children prefer to play games on computers and mobile phones but others play on the latest play stations. Modern types of games based on  fighting themes like attacking and fighting with each other etc. PUBG game is the best example. In this game, a battlefield creates and 100 people are dropped on this battlefield, and they are in the form of groups and each group contain four members. They all fight with the help of different types of latest arms with each other. In 2020 a crime was reported in Lahore Pakistan, a boy killed her mother and sister with a gun same to this game theme. After investigating  this case, it was clear that the boy plays a lot of PUBG and now he was not mentally stable. The same scenario also happened  in New Zealand where a man killed many people in a mosque.\n\nNevertheless, other people say that these types of games do not create any bad impact on the life of an individual. Furthermore, these games increase the power of command and increase the decision power in the children. \n\nTo conclude, the bad effects of these are overweight. Because many incidents have occurred owing to these types of violent games. However, there are just a few benefits of these games like increasing the decision power.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da trinh bay hai quan diem chu yeu: mot so nguoi tin rang violence tren truyen hinh va trong tro choi may tinh co tac dong tieu cuc den xa hoi, trong khi mot so nguoi khac phu nhan dieu nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more people move from the countryside to big cities. Does this development bring more advantages or disadvantages to the environment\"\nEssay:\n\"Urbanization has been accelerating in the past few decades, with increasing numbers of populations migrating from the countryside to the urban areas. However, this trend causes a series of problems that can not be ignored.\n\nTo provide sufficient housing for residents, parks and green lands are replaced by residential buildings. When the open spaces in the urban areas could be used up, a common practice is to reclaim more land from the suburban area, which is considered an unsustainable way. The reduction of greenery coverage and the damage to the ecological environment are unavoidable as the limited  resources cannot accommodate so many dwellers in metropolises.\n\nThe large number of urban populations is also responsible for various kinds of pollution. Air pollution has become a big concern that plagues inhabitants and the main source of air pollutants is the growing number of private cars. Moreover, in order to create more jobs to meet the demand for employment, many factories are built inside or around there, and they emit waste gas into the atmosphere, pollute the water and soil surrounding there and create a lot of noise with their machinery.\n\nSome may argue that with immigrants moving from the countryside to cities, the rural areas can benefit in terms of the environment. However, these benefits are not comparable to the problems faced in metropolises. The vast space of the countryside has an advantage in cleansing the pollutants, and the pollution generated by its sparse population is much less than that in the densely-populated cities.\n\nOverall, in the process of urbanization, many environmental issues may occur and need to be dealt with in a proper manner.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Violent TV-shows and aggressive video games should be banned on governmental level.\n\nDo you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is a view that vicious TV programmes and hostile video games should be prohibited by the governments. In my opinion, this is the best thing to do as these only help to increases criminalality in the younger generation.\n\nTo begin with, shows made for TV and electronic games are made based on the popularity among the crowd. This is because the people used to vent their frustrations in their social life playing games and watching shows. Nowadays the games and shows become more violent as the discrimination in the society increases and most of them sees themselves in the characters in the shows and games and divert their anger to the other characters in these platforms which they cannot do in real life. For example in a survey conducted by an online platform states that 70% of the people likes to play a boxing video game to reduce their anger on their bosses. These scenario is dangerous as these these behaviours will eventually becomes a pattern in their real life.\n\nSecondly, these type of contents are dangerous for children as they might not understand how abnormal it is. As the children sees these kind of shows and games they might thing these are normal behaviours and will become part of their life without understanding the dangers of it. For instance a survey conducted by American Psychological Association among students points that the kids are more leaning towards games like Bulletstorm which are very violent in nature. Hence it would be very useful for parents if these violent products are banned on the government level.\n\nIn conclusion, eventhough these shows and games are made as part of their popularity it could never deny the fact that it increases the criminality in the society and also increases the chance that the future generation might behave as in the characters of these shows and games as it is normal.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai duoc yeu cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people want to have elder siblings. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having elder siblings?\"\nEssay:\n\"Being an elder sibling means that a person has younger sisters or brothers. There are extremely number of people who are elder siblings. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being an elder sibling.\n\nThere are a few advantages of being an elder sibling. One obvious benefit of it is that elder siblings are usually matured. In other words, when an individual is an elder sibling, it means that he experienced a lot, he had more  vital situations than his brothers and sisters. Therefore, younger siblings always can ask for an advice and help. Elder siblings always help because of their maturity. Another evident merit of it is that elder siblings are given a big attention  by their parents. It can be noted that elder children are parent’s first children. Moreover, parents extremely wait for their first children. As a consequence, elder children get a lot of care. Hence, being matured and getting a lot of attention are the two main benefits of being an elder sibling. \n\nNevertheless, there are some disadvantages of being an elder sibling. Firstly, elder siblings always should  solve problems. When he or she is elder sibling, they always have to solve various questions and troubles. For instance, they might solve not only daily life questions, but also tackle a different tasks such as earning money, looking for little siblings. Secondly, elder siblings are expected many success by their parents. As elder children are first children, parents always wait for extremely amount of achievements while younger children aren’t requested so by parents. When this happens so often, it get elder siblings   annoyed.\n\nTo sum up, there are obvious advantages and disadvantages of being an elder sibling. In my opinion, being an elder sibling is cool, but sometimes it has own minuses.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den ca loi va nhuoc diem cua viec co anh chi em lon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some think that climate change reforms will negatively affect business. Others feel they are an opportunity for businesses.\n\nDiscuss both sides and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the change of world temperature is a controversial issue. While it is believed that many businesses could be destroyed by fixing global warming, I side with those who feel that solving this problem is a chance for many businesses. \n\nOn the one hand, it is argued that addressing the climate change could make some people unemployed. Those in favour of this idea state that one of the main sources of global warming is big factories using fossil as a source of energy to make their products. For example, everyday tons of gasoline is consumed in the building industry to produce bricks. As a result, by banning the use of this kind of fuel, a large number of factories could be closed, and many people working in this field have to look for a new job. Moreover, they claim that many car drivers could lose their jobs since old cars have an important role in air pollution and increasing dioxide carbon into the atmosphere. Thus, scrapping old cars could incur not only some low income drivers, but also could disrupt people’s transportation. \n\nHowever, efforts to tackle the climate change obstacles has capability to flourish many businesses. New sources of energy which are considered safe for the environment will be more popular, and by increasing the demands, the suppliers have to expand their businesses to provide the need of the society. For instance, many new power plants might be built which work with renewable energy, such as wind. In fact, many people can get a job in this new development. Furthermore, climate change reforms could have a positive effect on the car industry. Car companies could use a new technology to make electric cars which are more efficient and less pollutant for the environment. Since people try to have a role in improving environmental issues, they are more interested in buying electric cars which leads to more success for this business. \n\nIn conclusion, although climate change reforms might shut down some old building industries or car companies, it could succeed businesses using renewable and electric energy. Therefore, on balance, I believe reforms resulted from climate change efforts have positive impacts on businesses.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da xoay quanh cau hoi de bai va tra loi mot cach tuong doi day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"There is a lot of pressure on young people today to succeed academically. As a result, some people believe that non-academic subjects, such as physical education and cookery, should be removed from the school syllabus so that children can concentrate on academic work.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"The issue of reforming school curriculum in the educational system by dropping courses that are not concluded in STEM ( science, technology , engineering, maths) has sparked heated controversy, with the supporters maintaining that school juveniles should not be pressed by non-academic subjects and focus on crucial courses such as chemistry  , whilst the opponents claim that physical education, music and art play a vital role in the student's life. Personally, I support the latter opinion even though the former has some positive attributes.\n\nFirst of all, it is often argued that the younger experience a hectic schedule in the school curriculum and need to be refreshed and alleviate stress in order to continue giving their best and they can achieve it only by participating in art subjects such as physical education. Indeed, it is vital important students exercise and get away from reality for a while otherwise they will drive crazy and their performance will be submerged. It is clearly illustrated by recent scientific research which output that students who are not participating in non-academic courses tend to not pass with flying colours onaverage than those who play an instrument or volleyball. \n\nAnother point in support of my opinion is that even though the majority of children pursue a career in science there are also students who have an innate talent in music or art. In particular, being talented in playing guitar cannot be replaced by an academic subject such as maths or chemistry. Therefore, it is fair for them to have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and goals independently be it in academic or non-academic subjects.\n\nHowever, it is claimed that not only juveniles do not hit the books but also are exhausted after attending extracurricular activities. Admittedly, students have the tendency to overindulge once they participate in cookery, drawing. For instance, the aforementioned activities are challenging for them and according to a school's data in the North America students are less effective and are bored in STEM after their participation in non-academic subjects. Yet, this is not entirely true since children have a lot of energy and they can be bookworms as well as attending art or music classes simultaneously,\n\nAll things considered, although students can't concentrate totally after attending non-academic courses. I firmly believe that undergraduates are able to do both academic and non-academic subjects and it is crucial either include to the syllabus. Only then do students strike a balance in their hectic lifestyle and continue to enhance their skills spontaneously.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach neu ro quan diem cua minh ve viec giu lai cac mon hoc khong hoc thuat trong chuong trinh giang day cua truong hoc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, a few people earn extremely high salaries. Some people think that this is  good for a country., while others believe that the government should control salaries and limit the amount people can earn.\n\nDiscuss both views and giye your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"People hold distinctive opinions regarding a debate which is linked to whether people should earn high salaries or not. Some people assert that high salaries are beneficial for a country, while others claim that authorities should take some measures in terms of earnings. In my opinion, both sides have plausible arguments, which should not be overlooked.\n\nThe major reason why people are in favour of earning high salaries is advantageous is that globalization is increasing sharply every passing day.  With the ever-rising globalization, undeveloped and developing countries have to pay great salaries to qualified citizens living in these countries. People who are experts in their fields want to make great salaries; however, if they cannot earn high wages, they regard brain drain as inevitable. For instance, in Turkey, a great number of doctors immigrated to German because  the government did not meet their needs. In the light of this reality, many people living in Turkey faced deteriorated and insufficient health services.\n\nIn contrast to the argument clarified above, there is also a significant argument by the opponents who believe that governments should check wages and people should make money equally. It is possible to associate earning too high salaries with a variety of negative effects, one of which is lower education quality. When people earn high salaries, authorities have to allocate a huge part of the government budget for high salaries. Although education is the most important thing, today, many teenagers cannot go to school owing to huge school fees. Therefore, governments should allocate enough funds for education facilities instead of high wages.\n\nTo sum up, having elucidated both perspectives, I think it can be concluded that ignoring the vital points claimed by any of the two sides above would result in undesirable circumstances\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dung la trinh bay ca hai quan diem ve viec mot so nguoi kiem luong cao va su dieu chinh cua chinh phu ve luong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Entertainment such as electronic games on portal devices is harmful for individuals and the society they live in. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is a belief to many that entertainment in the form of video games and social media is harmful to society and individuals. The reasons regarding this bold accusation are numerous, some of which are health-related. Society grows devoid of communities/friendships, and is rather made up of antisocial introverts with next to zero communication skills. I profoundly understand and agree with this statement, thus the following paragraphs will deeply explore it.\n\nTo begin with, it is not far-fetched at all that social media detaches humans from reality. Scrolling for hours on end is everything but natural. Thereafter, the attention span is affected negatively, causing students difficulty when focusing on any given topic. Be that as it may, some cases are fine, one of which is spending quality time with your family by watching a film. Nonetheless, that does not excuse the overuse of electronics. E-games are known to be overstimulating, eventually making it hard for users to fulfill daily tasks in life due to their “boring nature”. What is more, is that dopamine is released in such immense quantities that actual beneficial activities such as reading books or playing sports grow underwhelming. On top of that, obesity is a likely destination for all couch potatoes that struggle to leave their rooms and touch grass, other than the fact that their friendships will gradually deteriorate.\n\nIn spite of being aware of the side effects of using portable devices 24/7, people are rendered addicted to tapping on their screens endlessly. Subsequently, many health issues, whether mental or physical, are invited. As previously stated, becoming overweight is a likely risk. Moreover, eye strain is caused slowly but surely, especially to those already suffering vision issues. Not to mention, depression has already affected most teenagers of our generation for this particular reason. Young adults nowadays spend most of their time straddling their phones, whereas the past generations lived life the right way with their friends and families. All motivation drops once a human is held captive by a metal object, which does nothing but waste time.\n\nIn conclusion, there are specific scenarios when switching on your phone is acceptable and harmless. However, 95% of the time it sucks the life out of humanity until we have no energy anymore. Therefore, my unwavering opinion is that limiting our screen time to a minimum is the best, as social media and video games are a waste of time.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response (Phan hoi cong viec):\n\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nWrite at least 250 words.\"\nEssay:\n\"In today’s world, the educational landscape has been changing over the past decade. It has given the flexibility and liberty for students to pursue different paths of education. Some think by homeschooling is the best way to guide the students at home whereas some believe students should go to school for a holistic learning experience. I will be discussing on both ways that can aid a child’s development.\n\nFirstly, homeschooling can save the time of travel and cost and the funds allocated for the child can be maximized by taking up his or favourite past time or hobby. More time can be  spent by each child at home and this can help the child to focus on weaker subjects. For instance, my cousin was homeschooled till 16 years old and she had ample time to have full concentration on all the academic subjects and scored well in college when she pursue higher education.          \n\nOn the other hand, it’s beneficial for students to attend school and gain a holistic learning experience. The students get chance to speak and interact with other classmates and they can have better soft skills in future. For example, Singapore’s high school students gain opportunities to work in a team and learn from one another for projects and presentations. This will inculcate interest to learn and deepen their understanding of the subjects that they pursue.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that both methods of educating a child are important in their own aspect. A safe and conducive environment and a school will help to guide a child and develop his or her path to success and build a good future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach thao luan ve loi ich cua ca viec ren luyen tai gia va di hoc tai truong hoc doi voi su phat trien cua tre con.

In my opinion the, the the merits of use social media in order to interaction among people outweigh the demerits because the social media provide healthy and comfortable method to interaction among people. \n\nOn the one hand, the primary downsides of interact in social media is make people  more vulnerable to get mental health issues namely, depression, and anxiety. This is because there are no face-to-face interaction among people. Furthermore, interact through social media such as, Facebook, Twitter,and  Snapcaht  can leads to misunderstanding among people. This is due the fact that there are no body language and emotions. \n\nOn the other hand, I would like to argue the benefits of interact among people via social media significantly more than drawbacks. The first advantage of social media it provide healthy environment for interaction among many individuals. To illustrates, people do not need to stay in the same place with others in order to communicate, which means people can avoid spread diseases. For example, when the Covid-19 pandemic started the governments around the world recommend their people to avoid face-to-face interaction in order to protect people from get this virus. Convenience is another benefit of employ social media to interact among people instead of face-to-face. This is because people can stay in touch with loved ones from their comfort their home rather than meet other people on the café or restaurant. \n\nTo sum up, although the social media can bring downsides including, make people feel isolated, I still believe the upsides of interaction via social media outweigh the downsides because social media offer healthy and convenient way  to interaction among people.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai va the hien quan diem cua minh rang loi ich cua viec su dung mang xa hoi vuot troi hon nhuoc diem.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Is this a negative or a positive trend?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is a well-documented fact that people tend to opt for having babies later in their life nowadays. This essay will analyze what the possible causes of the aforementioned trend are before explaining why the merits of giving birth late are outweighed by its drawbacks.\n\nThere have been plenty of reasons for people to choose delayed parenthood. However, I suppose that the two following reasons are the most fundamental. First and foremost, parents would like to have stable finances before welcoming new members to their families. Obviously, in order to have a proper child’s nourishment, many kinds of expenditures are required, such as food and drinks, clothes AND diapers. Therefore, it is essential that parents have a job with ADEQUATE income to afford the expenses needed to bring up a child. Another noteworthy point is the problem of parental skills. Besides having a considerable amount of money, should parents wish for the best development of the babies, time is asked for them to grow maturely enough to be exemplary teachers for their offspring. \n\nTwo sides of the trend should be thoroughly discussed before concluding whether it is a blessing. On the one hand, it is understandable why people state that delayed parenthood brings more advantages. The key rationale is mature parents can warrant qualities in children’s characteristics, which deserves to be put in priority. Only when parents have experienced life's ups and downs are they likely to offer their babies the greatest advice within their possibility. On the other hand, there are also a number of downsides. First of all, the more the women grow old, the weaker they will be in reproduction. Hence, aged mothers may be at stake of suffering from fatal consequences coming from giving birth like excessive bleeding or miscarriage. Furthermore, a big generation gap could occur. Accompanied with skillfully tutoring a child, old parents probably have to deal with differences in mindsets which parallelly cause obstacles for them to sympathize with their beloved offspring. Generally, full-grown parents are good, nevertheless, the problems of the mothers’ health and generation gap ought to be put in priority.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that people would like to have children late is mainly because of financial issues and parental skills and the positive repercussions associated with maturity ARE eclipsed by problems related to maternity’s health and generation gap.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, task response duoc dap ung dung voi yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The world of work is changing so fast that employees cannot depend on having the same job or working conditions. What are the possible causes for rapid change, and what suggestions could be given for preparing people?\"\nEssay:\n\"The current temp of living, changing different spheres and developing our society can dramatically illustrate that the conditions in which we function also are reinventing. So, both employee's and employer's work world isn't an exception: the high level of staff turnover and multitasking can be overwhelming and confusing, undermining people's and company's efficiency. But, fortunately, if there is a problem, there always exist some causes and, as a result, possible solutions.\n\nIt's often said that an unfavourable working environment (including rapid changes) can be a consequence of an unreasonable approach to create working areas and the wrong building of connections between workers at different levels of the hierarchy. Additionally, the lack of knowledge and absence of flexibility among employers can be one of the main reasons. And, finally, the \"puzzled position\" of business leaders and their misunderstandings of the value of long-term workers can be fatal conditions, which can lead to a negative atmosphere in the labour market.\n\nWe could solve the problem by maintaining an environment  which could help (workers) to keep the same jobs and offer much more suitable and comfortable working conditions. Also, I think it's a good idea to invest in mid-term and long-term employers by giving them opportunities to learn something new and expand the knowledge of their fields. Besides, workers and job-seekers also should realise that partly it's their responsibility to resist stress and be able to face absolutely new perspectives.\n\nTo conclude, it must be said that our world rebuilding and changes in the work area are inevitable, so it's necessary to see the whole situation and conditions of existing realistically.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va neu ra nhung nguyen nhan gay ra su thay doi nhanh chong trong cong viec mot cach ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Schools are no longer necessary because children can get so much information available through the internet, and they can study at home. To what extent you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern era of technology and online connectivity, a host of people argue that traditional schools are now superfluous given the abundance of information and learning resources available on the Internet. From my perspective, while Internet-based education has some remarkable advantages, traditional schooling is of paramount importance for the comprehensive development of children.\n\nTo begin with, the digital revolution has offered unprecedented access to a vast array of information and therefore radically reformed traditional teaching methods and approaches. Students, irrespective of their geological location, are now able to watch lectures delivered at reputable academies as well as study scientific research in a variety of fields on the Internet, which would not be otherwise available in traditional classes. Thus, a plethora of information is likely to foster not only students' independent learning but also their intellectual curiosity. Furthermore, these active learners can learn at their own pace and level with a view to optimising their learning outcomes.  \n\nOn the other hand, it is indisputable that traditional schooling has multifaceted benefits which go beyond the delivery of academic content. Firstly, it creates an academic atmosphere with both dynamic interaction and healthy competition between students. By conferring with their partners, each student has the propensity for pursuing a \"debate culture\", which is the key element in cultivating an immense sense of industry and competitiveness among them.For this reason, traditional classes act as a driving force in improving learners' interpersonal skills and peer support for mutual development. Meanwhile, instructors also play an important role to interpret abstract concepts into straightforward ones, helping students have thorough insights into lessons and accumulating a broad educational background.\n\nIn conclusion, although the adoption of technology has been a crucial breakthrough , I have a staunch belief that schools are essential for children's development.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTinh dung dan va phan ung voi yeu cau (Task Response)\n- Bai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach trinh bay quan diem ca nhan cua ban ve viec lieu truong hoc con can thiet hay khong.\n- Y tuong cua ban da duoc mo rong day du, voi viec cung cap cac ly do va vi du de ho tro quan diem cua ban.\n\nNhung co mot so diem can duoc cai thien va giai thich:\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some country, more people are choosing to live alone. \n\nDo you think it has positive or negative effects on them?\"\nEssay:\n\"Opinions are divided on whether it is beneficial  or detrimental when an increasing number of today's people are opting for a solitary lifestyle. This essay will explore both positive and negative effects on individuals.\n\nLiving a solitary life, on the one hand, could be disadvantageous, for various reasons related to loneliness and difficulties when they change their mind. The solo dwellers might feel lonely or even  isolated in some emotionally vulnerable moments while there is no one around, it becomes a struggle for them to unburden themselves. This circumstance exacerbates  people who live solitarily, causing them to suffer from mental and emotional issues which leads directly to an unhealthy mental life. In addition, the further explanation for this sensation is the negative feelings during festive seasons. When solo dwellers glimpse happy couples and joyful families. Alongside this, the decision to live alone could be temporary. Therefore, once they want to change in order to start a family, this intention might be far from a straightforward task.\n\nDespite the aforementioned downsides, this way of living could have its own merits, chief among which are a sense of freedom and self-improvement. People who choose to live alone will have some leeway to enjoy the independence of life without considering worrying about others' opinions or criticisms from co-living partners. For instance, solo dwellers can refurbish their nest or throw away a late-night party in the absence of their parent's preferences and limitations. Additionally,  solo living is said to be the most advantageous lifestyle that makes it easier for people to enhance their career. They will have chances to take advantage of their alone time and space to develop their personal skills, for example, financial management, repair skill, cooking, etc... as well as nurture their individual interest. If they settle for a co-living way of life which means living with their parents or spouses, they tend to count on the others.\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that the desirable experience of solo living could have both favourable impacts from an individual perspective.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDanh gia Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

Others argue that it is more important for schools to give prizes for other achievements (for example, for sports, music and behaviour). Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"A prize is an award form which encourages people, especially children, to gain a success. Therefore, a group of community believes that school heads should grant their students due to their academic results, while others insist on the importance of honour for other achievements on focusing to talent. Personally, I agree with the both ideas and this essay wil discuss my point of view in the following paragraphs, including some examples from my own experience.\n\nIn the first instance, it is argued that school-goers should be assigned for their scholastic successes, such as international owlypia, steam olympiads, semi-final and final scores and etc. By awarding them, teachers, may create enthusiasm towards diligency, as well as it increases rivalry among youngsters. For instance, in 2015 when I was studying at 3rd grade of university, the government set an scholarship, about being able to study one year in London, for winning in the competition with other university. Almost 80% of faculties had participated in the competition willingly. Therefore, adolescents may be encouraged to get hang of their lessons.\n\nOn the other hand, being talented in the various fields, such as sport, music, behaviour, should be appreciated, respectively. It is undeniable that, a gifted musician or sportsman may represent his or her country in the international arenas. To illlustrate, last month, 7 students of our lyceum which I work, had brought 7 gold, 5 silver medals from judo competition, organized in France, to our country. The founder of lyceum had organized honours ceremony and accordad all the participants because of their initiatives. I believe that the number of competitors, who wants to take part in the international games, will have been increased. \n\nTo conclude, with all of the examples that I have listed above, I believe that teenagers should be rewarded due to their personal ability, with the aim of creating favoured environment to show capacity.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that social networking sites have a huge negative impact on both individual and society.To what extent do you agree or disagree？\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that social networking sites have a huge negative impact on both individuals and society .Although it has some positive impact ,I would argue that the negative impact is outweighed.\n\nTo begin ,with In a larger communication platform, broaden their own social circle. because social software in addition to more convenient contact with  relatives and friends, it can also let us know more like-minded people, such as wechat shake a shake and so on are let us know more \"strangers\" away. In addition, we can also post some interesting texts and videos on social software such as Weibo, TikTok, etc. These contents are public, if there are people who are interested in these contents, they will naturally comment on them, so that we will always meet a lot of like-minded people.In addition Social software can help people to know the world faster, because of its large information content and fast update speed, you can know the latest events of the world in a few seconds, such as some aviation news or the latest hot news about the entertainment circle. This can help people make the right judgment, know what is right and what is not right, and prevent going astray.\n\nDespite these benefits, I still believe that it has a lot of negative impacts.Firstly,False fraud information is numerous and easy to spread. Because now with the promotion of the Internet, all kinds of network fraud emerge  endlessly, so that you are impossible to guard against. Among them, the fraud methods lurking in the major social software, such as some issuing false advertisements in various groups and broadcasting false information on major live platforms. Those people use various means to infiltrate the major social software. People are going to lose a lot of money to these new scams.In addition, secondly, Social media has a lot to do with people's mental health, because studies have found a correlation between social media use and psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. People may be subjected to online violence because of some photos or videos posted on social media, they will evaluate and ridicule a person by height, or appearance. which will cause mental illness.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that social media can let us know about the world and make more new friends, but I still believe that social media can also let us be cheated or make us psychologically hurt or even astray.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach khang dinh rang mang xa hoi co tac dong tieu cuc lon den ca ca nhan va xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?\"\nEssay:\n\"One of the heated issues is there are less students following science-related subjects in university. Many people think that this situation cannot cause any negative effects. However, I do believe that the lack of science students might cause severe consequences on society. In this essay, I will give my own opinion on the reasons and causes of the shortage of science students.\n\nThere is no doubt that the number of students choosing science has decreased dramatically in recent years. There are many reasons for this. For one thing, many undergraduates found science-related subjects difficult and not attractive enough. For another, science subjects taught in the current educational program are so impractical that undergraduates cannot apply what they learn in real life situations. The most familiar example of this is that Vietnamese students have to learn a lot of unrealistic knowledge that cannot help them much in their work. On the other hand, many students having a great passion for science may not have enough money to pay because of the high  educational fee in university. It seems quite clear that these factors have a significant contribution to the decrease of science students.\n\nIt is well known that the shortage of undergraduates learning science may cause extreme effects on society. As many students found science unattractive, students can easily get bored of science. The science subjects boredom is the main reason for the lack of science students which can lead to the shortage of science workers in the future. Take Vietnam for an example, if this situation keeps continuing, Vietnamese patients will have struggled with the decrease in the number of doctors in 50 years’ time. To address this problem, the Vietnamese government has worked out many measures to attract more students to choose to study science at university. In a nutshell, this problem must be tackled quickly. \n\nIn conclusion, the decline in science-related  subjects students can cause terrible effects. Both governments and their citizens have to take action to address this constructively.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ve su thieu hut sinh vien hoc cac mon khoa hoc va tac dong cua van de nay doi voi xa hoi.

Although these modern techniques like videos and snaps are effective, I do not agree that we should replace books with it. In this essay, I will elaborate on my viewpoint with relevant examples. \n\nFirstly, this is undeniable that these facilities bring benefits for students and teachers, and make the education process more flexible. For instance, tutors could create practical examples of the materials they teach by using videos or by showing short movies, in addition, it enhances learners' understanding of some complicated curriculums or difficult subjects such as Geography and Geology. Therefore we can say that these methods are proven to be sophisticated and have an overwhelming endorsement particularly in developed countries such as America and Europe. \n\nOn the other hand, book is the tradional way of studying for ages. It plays an indispensable role in forming students' awareness, it is the first and foremost tool in teaching. For example, in developing countries where technology is expensive or not available, book is the only tool to use in teaching, thus we cannot deny its significant importance. In addition, it attracts young learners who are captivated by colorful photos and stories written in books, moreover, those who have a reading hobby would find books attractive instead of videos and films.\n\nIn conclusion, although using books in teaching sometimes sounds tedious and time-consuming, we can not replace it with other techniques, furthermore, films, TV, and computer are not available many places over the globe.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai cho toi muc do nhat dinh, nhung diem tra loi chua duoc phat trien day du va mach lac.

While hasty decisions can lead to regrets and failures, embracing risks is necessary for progress and development. Though some fear losing what they have, the advantages of taking risks often outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nAdmittedly, risks entail uncertainty, and missteps can result in adverse consequences, potentially harming relationships and overall well-being. However, learning from negative experiences and setbacks can provide valuable life lessons and foster personal growth. By using these lessons to their advantage, individuals can progress in their careers and improve the quality of their lives.\n\nSuccessful people, especially entrepreneurs and innovators, are often characterized by their willingness to take risks and embrace failures as stepping stones toward eventual success.

Personally, I strongly believe that this kind of action ought to be taken in most cities, as it has plenty of benefits for both citizens and environment.\n\nOn the one hand, forbidding the use of private vehicles in certain city areas definitely has numerous advantages for environment. In other words, people can reduce the number of problems related to the pollution of environment by simply stopping driving personal cars that emit gases and other pollutants.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is no denying the fact that economy is the main factor to convert developed contry to advanced country. While it is a commonly held belief that rich nations occasionally donate money to poorer nations, but it rarely consider as a solution for poverty, so they should help them in another way rather than financial aid. This essay will analyse this topic from both points of view and express my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, rise economy improve the general state in country, also there is no better way than gave donate to make the nations get up again. In other words donates will make minstries of education and health better, also transfer the place to modern and beauty. For addition some nations are stronge in budget, but they have exceptations, because they need workers and strong governments to list the rules that population walk on it, rather than take money. For example, Russia nowadays faces stress from all sides and it economy noticeable became fewer, also has internal issue.\n\nAnother point to consider, economy is a main factor to solve poverty, but if the nations did not use their economy in best way, such grow up farmers and build industries, dontaes wont effect in positive way. It is also possible to say that nation is taken care by others it did not receive money everytime, it should upgrade it self. For instance, used it donates to request coporations or companies for it transportation, bulding and industires. \n\nIn conclusion, despite people having different view, I tend to believe that, previously  money solve millions issues, nowadays money solve billions it is the main factor to solve everything.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dung la tra loi cau hoi de bai boi vi ban da thao luan ve viec tai tro tai chinh tu cac quoc gia giau co khong phai la giai phap cho ngheo doi va de xuat rang cac quoc gia phat trien nen cung cap cac hinh thuc tro giup khac cho cac quoc gia ngheo.

From my perspective, I agree with this view and this essay will address the reasons for my views.\n\nThere are several reasons related to making money is not dependent on public responsibilities. First of all, people start a business  they will be an improved reputation with their customers. If the business had had public responsibilities, it would have made more money. However, the business of the company does not nonce social responsibilities will be no sympathy and people in society ostracised. Therefore, the businesses give priority to growing businesses that will not be had opportunities in their jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons  why I am convinced that the business prioritizes generating profits will not be the best way to expand the business. The product of business not only makes more profits but also has the effect of factory emissions and pollution. Almost the company has damage to affect environmental degradation  the reason why leads to no improvement in customers. Consequently, some companies can not be had prestige in the community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that companies can  put a high priority on maximising profits more than have public responsibilities.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da de cap den viec rang doanh nghiep khong can phai co trach nhiem xa hoi va dong y voi quan diem nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Plastic bags, plastic bottles and plastic packaging are bad for environment. What damage does plastic do to the environment? What can be done by governments and individuals to solve this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"These days the items made of the plastic such as bottles and packaging are becoming a huge threat to our environment. These non biodegradable materials have detrimental effects on the fertility of soil and purity of air as well as water. Authorities and people should take stern steps like banning the use and manufacturing of plastic items as well as implementing the concept of reduce and reuse.\n\nTo start with, the prime damaging effect of plastic on our surroundings is that it reduces the productivity of soil. Being a water resistant material, plastic prevents the rain water from seeping into the ground. Thereby, it reduces the level of moisture much needed for the fruit fullness of soil and turns the land into barren. Furthermore, it takes hundreds of years for a single plastic bottle to decompose in our ecosystem. Therefore, to get rid of the heaps of plastic waste, people generally burn the domestic and industrial non degradable waste, and this process emits extremely harmful gases namely carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide. These gases deteriorate the quality of air and accelerate the air pollution by increasing the percentage of minute particles. In addition, the chemicals in the plastic products often reach water bodies and affect the quality of water. This results in the devastation of marine wildlife and vegetation.\n\nTo resolve the issues caused by plastic products on our ecosystem / environment, the government should issue strict guidelines like banning the utilisation of single use plastic as well as its manufacturing. Owing to these measures, the presence of unwanted material will automatically decrease in our surroundings. Gradually, the quality of air, soil and water will improve. Similarly, people should apply the policy of reducing and reusing the material. If people use carry bags made of cloth instead of plastic, it will prove as a turning point in protecting / saving our ecosystem. Also people should adopt the habit of reusing and recycling the products available to them. This will control the consumption and manufacturing of articles of plastic. In other words, joint efforts of the administration and citizens are required to bring about a drastic change.\n\nTo conclude, plastic pollutes the air, water and soil and thus harms our environment in so many ways. Collective efforts of the government and the public are required to control the use and abuse of plastic.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach day du va chinh xac.

The healthy movement may include sports, walking, yoga or running. Obviously, physical activity helps to keep fit. Moreover, it includes a well-balanced low-fat diet. At the same time, people should drink more water and stay hydrated. It is a discipline that every individual should have. For example, nobody could not to force others to keep a healthy lifestyle.

It may be stadion, parks, treadmills and so on. Also, the state can provide it for free. Furthermore, they could make a variety of physical competitions with prizes. It will increase the interest of people to take a part. For instance, there is a marathon where all people want to join.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the world of the internet, people write product reviews of products and services. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"In modern network society, the vast majority of people tend to commended all goods and services that they purchased or recieved on the social pathform as they claim that there are many benefits for another people that still concerned about the products or services. However, there are those who argues that there are heaps of merchandise’s reviews are unrealistic as well. This essay argues stongly in favour of the latter position.\n\nOn the on hand, it certainly true that the positive reviews on the social media can attract the new customers and increase sales. That means as much as number of good reviews then, as much as profit for the business as well. For instance, There are shop “A” and “B” in the same location, venue A recieved 5 star reviews from a thousan people while venue B just got only 20 peoples for 3 star reviews,thus clearly that when people see both store reviews, shop A is the best selection choice definitely. Consequently, nowadays, most stores attempt to collect the positive comments on social network as much as possible to lead their business growths, even add the promotion for the customer who provide a good review for them. \n\nIn spite of this, it cannot be denied that plentiful reviews are fake. As both users who support those businesses by write an exaggrerate review and even the people who focus to destroy those works by provide them a demerit commend. That because of some of them might recieved funds to built up the unreal merit comments ,which the same as those people who anti thoes brands personally as they may try to add a negative story on their reviews as well. To illustrate, the main financial fund that YouTubers earn from their sponsors, therefore, they cannot review anything drawback about the products that they recieved from their sponsors. Accordingly, we cannot touch anything until we try or face it by ourself.\n\nin conclusion, Although customer reviews on social media have plentiful beneficially impacts for the new customers and sales, there are enormous fake reviews that we cannot touch as well.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, noi dung khong tra loi day du yeu cau cua de bai.

While in other places, workers are anticipated to continue to work in the facility. While remote working is more comfortable and flexible, I believe that going to the office is more productive and interactive.\n\nOn the one hand, working from home has two main advantages. Firstly, staying at home to work eliminates the need to travel to the site. As a result of that, the cost of comminution is alleviated as well as it saves a lot of time. Furthermore, this leads to the relief of traffic congestion in the downtown. In addition to that, people will have more flexibility in their time management. the reason for this is that They don`t have to clock in and out at certain times. This leads to them having an excellent work-life balance.\n\nOn the other hand, going to the office has its own benefits. in the first place, working in groups elevates communication and interaction between co-workers. This is because a lot of new ideas are presented and exchanged between them. Consequently, this leads to a healthier performance. Additionally,  by being on-site, clerks tend to be more productive as they are more concentrated on their jobs. This causes their businesses to do well.\n\nIn conclusion, although working through the Internet provides jobholders with comfy working conditions, being inside the company makes workers more motivated and helps them provide quality products.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem: cho phep lam viec tu xa va lam viec tai van phong.

There are several advantages and disadvantages about this happening.\n\nAs, the number of young adults grows in different countries there will be a lot of educated and hard-working generation in workplacesm. Although, they do not have such experience that the elder specialist have but they are much younger. They are not only passionate but also they do not emphesise in the payment because they are in the stage of gaining experience and investing in themselves. But, when elders become close to their retirement the companies have a big concern about new employment and that is why they prevent to have a person who doesn’t have any work experience as long as they can keep their specialist manajor.\n\nBesides, elder groups are very costful for governments. Although, they pay taxes in their lifespam but as they become older they need more medication services. For example, tablets, private nurse, wheelchair and so on. In addition, they need more attention and transportation options have to be provided for all aged members. Because, they can not easily walk in steeps or use taxi and bus. So, they make a lot of financial problem for government.

Realistically, a wide variety category and most popular creator, it seems obvious. But the idea of having better movies depends on degree to consideration by states might be possible. \n\nTo begin, there are some reasons why international movies are more attractive than local films. First and foremost, they belong to entirely professional companies, Such as Netflix or Sony. Accordingly, the best directors who are able to absorb the best screen plays or actress in across the world have been accompanying with them. Therefore, after watching those kinds of movie folk expectancies are going to be increase towards local movies. To illustrate it, after watching Avatar which belongs to the one of the most famous company Fax, movies seekers unconsciously compare the features with itself movies. On the other hand, curiosity might be another reason regardless of how a film is perfectly created. Thus, people find details of other cultures full of experiences. like what they ponder, how interact, or even associated foods and clothes. \n\nIn my sight, there is a strong connection between how much countries consider budget and how their movies are becoming well-known. However, the measure of that might not be as much as international movies in particular those are related Hollywood. Fore instance “about the Eli” is a film that generally admitted in my area, in fact, not only locally but also globally. Irrefutably, the pillar of this achievement is up to the amount of investment. In addition, movies have the incredible capacity to gather attention in the case of tourism too. Hence, found could turn back by buying film and even attempting to travel as well. According to evidence, so many people have traveled to see closely popular houses in movies like the friend’s coffee shop. \n\nTo sum up, spectaculars excitement for international movies is deniable. But, beyond any doubt high-quality productions are capable of convincing people of whatever they want to trace.

Most often than not all of the above courses provide a better tenure to a student after graduation.\n\nFuthermore, students that has decided to take a specific course will have a better perspective in what they trully want in their futures.

Moreover, a job order or a temporary position will only give you a contract for a certain year or a period, even you have renewed your contract for a long time if the company you are working is not interested that you will be a full - time worker, you will still end up being a temporary agent. Futhermore, temporary jobs are somtimes a scam, a news agency (TVN7) announced that some of these jobs such as, part time online networking jobs, online financial advisor, and an account assistant job are part of a big social scheme leaving individual on dept if they fell in this kinds of temporary jobs. \n\nIn conclusion, there are many things to consider if a person wants to be employed, temporary positions have more benefits if you are just careful in choosing your job to sustain your everyday life.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai, tuc la ban da thao luan ve loi va hai cua viec lam tam thoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?\n\nSome people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is claimed by some that flights for long distances utilize fuel as corn which use for long-time periods, although they both cause the same amount of contamination and in order to remedy this problem it is proposed by society to cancel unimportant flights, such ad tourist trips rather than to reduce the use of cars. As far as I am concerned, I partly disagree with this statement. \n\nAdmittedly,  in these present days due to planes, the environment is suffering more. Therefore, some individuals want the government to restrict flights for long distances. In truth, it would be great, if the government set the strict schedules up for use. As a consequence, not much fuel will be spent and there will be more provisions for vehicles. \n\nOn the contrary, it is hard to solve the problems. First and foremost, people travel for different purposes. The principal causes might be medicine, studying and travel as well. Nowadays, most individuals are more likely to work very hard and due to this they should relax by travelling  abroad.  Also some humans have a journey in seeking treatment for their illnesses. \n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that both cars and planes have a negative effect on the environment, but the decision of discouraging tourist air travel and increasing the utilization of cars can be misleading.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach bay to quan diem rieng cua ban ve cau hoi da duoc dua ra.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Information technology inables many people to do their work outside their workplace (eg: at home, when traveling, etc.). Do the benefits of this mobility outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Several individuals are of the opinion that the evolution of gadgets allows to a significant number of persons, to do their job without the need of attending the office. On one hand, there are numerous advantages that come with this flexibility, but on the other hand, there are also a great amount of disadvantages. In this essay,  I am going to focus and examine this question from both points of view.\n\nFirstly, on one side of the argument, there are individuals who think that an important benefit of working from home is time-saving. As a result, most individuals lose a serious amount of time in traffic, as well as in public transportation. A particularly good example here is a recent study, which shows that an average person usually spends around one to two hours, going and coming from their workplace.\n\nSecondly, one of the main problems that arrives with working outside the office, is the lack of interaction with other people. As a consequence of this, numerous individuals tend to become unsociable and uncomfortable around people. One good illustration of this is the multitude of our society members, which declared that after long periods of time working from home, they became more shy and introverted.\n\nOn the whole, the development of information technology has both positive as well as negative effects on our work environment. As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that the advantages that come with this flexibility outweigh its disadvantages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some cities public parks and open spaces are being changed  into gardens where local residents can grow their own fruits and vegetables. Do the advantages outweigh disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"These days in several cities public spaces such as parks are being converted into gardens in order to support local dwellers to plant fruit and vegetables. This trend has merits and demerits as well.\n\nTo begin with, the benefits of this change are varied. Firstly, local people can achieve enormous provisions by gardening. The most important thing is that during harvesting citizens are able to get reliable products. As a consequence, they can consume healthy fruits and vegetables, which are rich in vitamins and minerals as well. ,Also it can fill the people's deficit for healthy fruit. Furthermore,  gardening is a good motivation, which leads to a healthy lifestyle. In truth, gardens need regular care by individuals. This, in turn, makes people do regular physical work. Additionally, they might avoid obesity and remedy other health issues. In a sense, there will be a more healthy and hardworking population. \n\nOn the contrary, there are also some serious drawbacks to this phenomenon. It is true that there are not enough green areas for other local residents in some regions. Hence, a plethora of people might stay without gardens. According to scientists' words, walking through parks can relieve people's stress. However, due to the ,gardens there will be a lack of spaces for relaxation. Lastly, giving open fields for gardening may affect other spheres of the economy.  To put it simply, an agricultural country without industry is not able to develop in all respects. \n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that changing some public places into gardens and guiding them for local dwellers is not a positive development.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Accommodation and transport problems are increasing in many large cities, and as a solution, businesses are being encouraged to move to rural areas.\n\nDo the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"In contemporary society, increased shelter and transportation shortages have affected individuals of all ages who are living in megacities. To handle the serious societal problem, businesses have been proposed to move to country areas. While the plan provides undeniable pros, such as the improvement of road congestion and decreased housing insufficiency in urban areas, and stimulation of the rural economy, its cons, including deprivation of parental care for some children whose parents have to work in some industries, located far away from urban regions. Moreover, a threat to those kids' psychological health careful consideration. \n\nOne of the compelling merits of location change of businesses, addressing traffic congestion cases happening, such as the lack of parking areas, and car accidents. Consequently, most of the residents can save much time, spending in handling the diverse array of annoying traffic issues. In addition, crowded housing almost will be solved, because some families have family members who are employed in some big businesses that will be moved into rural regions, and these households definitely follow their companies and live in regions, far away from suburban regions. As a result, the rest of the individuals will get more space to live. Lastly, the plan may stimulate the economic development of country regions, relying on the number of inhabitants has surged with an influx of business, especially, bringing more commercial behavior, such as merchandise purchases; thus, benefitting both local individuals' life standards. \n\nHowever, the disadvantage of the idea is equally pronounced. it may bring a negative influence on younger mental health. Advanced educational sources that are located in the metropolis, have become a major reason why most parents choose to live far away from their children when they need to work in suburban areas. Moreover, although it is beneficial for the development of kids' independence, obviously, damages their psychological health due to the lack of emotional support. Hence, business relocation may allow some younger parents stuck in a dilemma.\n\nIn essence, the proposition of business relocation from the city to the suburb definitely offers an effective solution for housing and traffic issues in the metropolitan, while encouraging the development of the economy in country areas. Nevertheless, exacerbating mental health for children living without parents, cannot be dentable. To strike a balance, local governments and authorities must allocate more funding to foster the richness of the educational system in rural regions, while encouraging businesses to move.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In education and employment, some people work harder than others. Why do some people work harder? Is it always a good thing to work hard?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the domains of education and employment, the level of effort people invest in their work can significantly vary. Some individuals display remarkable dedication and perseverance, while others seem less motivated to put in the extra effort. This discrepancy in work ethics raises questions about the reasons behind these differences and whether working harder is always advantageous. Understanding the underlying factors and implications of varying work ethics is crucial to foster a more productive and balanced workforce.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the differences in work ethics among individuals. Intrinsic motivation plays a vital role, with passionate individuals having clear goals and being more inclined to work harder. Cultural background and upbringing also influence work ethics, as those raised in environments that value hard work are more likely to exhibit a strong work ethic. Moreover, external incentives, recognition, and rewards in the workplace or educational settings can influence an individual's willingness to put in extra effort.\n\nWorking harder often leads to numerous benefits. It enhances productivity and efficiency, resulting in higher output and improved performance. Diligent individuals are more likely to acquire advanced skills, positioning themselves for better career opportunities. Moreover, their commitment and dedication can inspire others, fostering a positive and competitive environment. In the context of education, hardworking students tend to achieve higher grades, gain a deeper understanding of subjects, and develop valuable study habits for the future.\n\nWhile working harder can bring several advantages, it is not always a universally beneficial approach. Striking a balance between dedication and maintaining personal well-being is essential to avoid burnout and ensure sustainable success. Encouraging a culture that values hard work while recognizing the importance of work-life balance can lead to a more productive and fulfilled workforce.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTren tong the, bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va co y tuong duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Advertisments of snacks and toys have a great impact on children and their parents. So, the advertisement to children should be banned. Do you agree or disagree\"\nEssay:\n\"People earn an excellent income by using advertisements on social networks. Notice that snacks and toys substantially affect children and their parents. So the publicities to the heir should be banned. This trend could be highly harmful. \n\nFirstly, little children pester their parents to buy the products advertised on TV and Social media. \n\nTo explain more, children may force their parents to buy unnecessary commodities by seeing advertisements, which can cause serious family disputes. Advertising is often for products and services that children do not need. Children are drawn towards consumerism when they see advertisements. Commercials easily influence children and then pester their parents to buy certain products. A lot of adverts create artificial wants for children. For example, the Coca-Cola company must devote some of its markets to selling specifically to children. Their company never talks about the disadvantage of soft drinks on children's physical and mental health. \n\nThus, schools and parents must teach children the skills to evaluate and analyze advertisements. \n\nSecondly, children cannot differentiate between actual TV programs and commercials. \n\nTo explain more, children see advertising as their media food. That is, as it uses the content of an animation, cartoon, or puppet program, she also consumes advertising. \n\nAdditionally, using children's film heroes and favorite cartoon characters in advertisements should be illegal. Advertising gives children the illusion that everyone has free access to all material things. For example, companies should not advertise fast food to children while they are growing up because it can be disadvantageous for children. Thus, some countries have already banned advertising targeted at young children. \n\nTo conclude, not only is advertising bad for children and parents, but also it is significantly impacting their mental and physical health. It would be a great idea if countries banned advertising, not only parents are helped but children are helped too.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va cung cap y tuong phu hop voi de bai.

In my view, I believe that  the main priority of every country and governments is that they ought to emphasis on their own citizens because they are certain issues that need to be handled.\n\nTo begin with, there are some reasons why governments could not always help poor people outside of their country. This is because they already have some obstacles within the country that should be tackled rather than help others. For example, air pollution and traffic congestion are the main increasingly worrying problems facing the whole world. Instead of supporting people in need in other parts of the world government should concentrate on solving existing problems that people are experiencing. Therefore, in my point of view focus should be placed to deal with problems within the country. \n\nNevertheless, it is believed by some countries from disadvantaged background should be given humanitarian aid by some affluent countries. Some countries, for example, African nationals are facing some difficulties such as famine and suffering from certain diseases as well. To be addressed this problem developed states ought to assist these developing countries in need with drugs foods and clothes as well as sending qualified doctors to treat patients who became a victim some serious illness.\n\nIn conclusion, it is hard to help all people around the world in need so governments should meet their citizens needs to make their lives better than aid others.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da dua ra quan diem cua minh ve viec chinh phu nen tap trung vao nguoi dan trong nuoc hay khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it.\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"There is ongoing debate that whether or not adverts are crucial for individuals. While some people argue that it is necessary for buying the advanced products which arrive in the market as well as  special discounts, others believe that there is no time to pay attention to these commercial ads as they are really common. This essay will discuss both views and argue in favour of the former.\n\nOn the one hand, if advertising of products is not held, the masses will not be able to acquire   knowledge of the products which are introduced in the supermarkets. Therefore, bulletins help to purchase the latest items coming across the world. Moreover, it also provides  intensive knowledge of how appliances work and flourishes with deals on the items which ultimately encourage humankind to buy things. For instance, people are more indulged in shopping during  Boxing Day in Canada as most of the outlets are posting  deals on the special brand at the end of the year.\n\nOn the other hand, humans are so hectic with their schedules therefore, they do not have enough duration to pay attention to these offers going on television or social media platforms. In the current era, prices of every item are so high that people just want to purchase those things which are required and they can run for perennial. Most of them just skip these ads as they think that it is waste of time in watching these advertisements. For example, a YouTube director predicted that 99% of individuals prefer to skip the advertisement at the start of a new video because they think it is useless to watch them.\n\nIn conclusion, although adverts are so common to be avoided to preserve time,  they play a significant role in saving chunks of money by forcing people to buy products when there are deals going on as well as they also provide detailed information on items.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban co tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem va trinh bay y kien cua minh.

What can the arts tell us about life that science and technology cannot?\"\nEssay:\n\"Although the world has seen a considerable growth of science and technology, art still holds a certain importance in the cultural and spiritual life of people because of the benefits which humans have received from the artist such as musicians, painters and writers not from scientists. In my opinion, there are many valuable things that almost all people can study based on these arts.\n\nAdmittedly, nowadays, humans have many kinds of entertainment activities which help the spiritual enhancement of life. These activities are not indispensable for balancing life and work. It is because of its benefits that it is easy to find short-term art classes widely held in many centres as a method of relaxation, emotional expression and creativity. This is extremely necessary in daily life while science and technology seem to ignore them.\n\nBesides, art also creates the human value through their work that no technology can be transmitted. Take a writer for an example, they have strong power to spread meaningful stories and positive energy to communities that can contribute, maintain and develop the good culture and tradition of each nation. Moreover, In medicine, doctors used music as a tool to ease the pain of the treatment regimens, especially for patients who meet mental problems. This not only brings many benefits but also reduces recovery time. \n\nIn conclusion, science and technology bring much knowledge about modern things but art helps people deeply understand and know what they want to be.Therefore, both of them should be maintained and developed equally to ensure no loss of traditional and cultural value of the nation.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai: \"What can the arts tell us about life that science and technology cannot?\" Ban da thao luan ve loi ich va gia tri cua nghe thuat trong cuoc song cua con nguoi va doi chieu voi khoa hoc va cong nghe.\n\nTuy nhien, co mot so diem can duoc nang cao trong viec tra loi cau hoi va mo rong y tuong:\n\n1.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"Science has long been seen as the flagship of progress, continually improving the quality of human life. While some people argue that the main goal of science is to improve people’s lives, others may argue that it serves an overall purpose. In this essay, I will express my agreement with the view that the ultimate aim of science should indeed be to enhance human’s need, supported by relevant examples from various scientific advances.\n\nOne of the most compelling examples of science is in the field of medicine. To be more specific, the development of vaccines and antibiotics has changed the face of healthcare and saved millions of lives. For example, the cure for smallpox is evident in science's ability to alleviate human suffering and prevent the death of countless individuals. \n\nIn addition, science also helps to improve lives and also extends to conserving the environment. Research on climate change and sustainable energy solutions is vital to preserving the planet. The ideals of reducing carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources are essential to mitigating the impacts of climate change on communities around the world.\n\nUltimately, science has played a crucial role in agriculture development, enabling increased food production and solving hunger.  Through the development of crop varieties and advanced farming practices, science has improved the lives of farmers and consumers. For example, the Green Revolution significantly increased crop yields, alleviating food shortages in some areas of the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the core purpose of science must certainly revolve around improving people's lives. Also, science can continue to be a powerful field for good, promoting a brighter future for all of humanity.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi cu the cau hoi de bai:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

Therefore, some individual would believe that, this phenomena will affect both in health and environment prospect. This essay will examine both perspective of this phenomenon and my personal opinion on this.\n\nTo begin with, significant growth of population around the globe could create dilemma in agriculture market, and so organic food resources would not be enough for everyone. However, scientific research have oriented a laboratory grown vegetables, which would indirectly help to regenerate human need in agriculture shortage. In addition, there are several other options which also can be determine for this obligations.

Although, injecting plantation with food chemical could also reflect better result in upcoming complications to solve. \n\nOn the other hand, chemically originated vegetables and edibles can not consider secure or ideal choice to eat regularly. Furthermore, genetically produce items neither going to give crucial benefits in vitamins not improve environment. For instance, this approach will only create delusion among communities in future planning and safety. As a result, it would rather going to harm the whole agriculture sector, yet along with it will alter disease and trouble too.\n\nTo sum too, theoretically unnatural engineered and genetically implanted food is also a marvel innovation, but in practical it will rather encourage problems in healthcare and surrounding.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Wealthy countries should accept more refugees and provide them with basic assistance, such as food and housing. To what extend do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is argued that rich nations ought to allow greater numbers of forced migrants past their borders and give them humanitarian relief. This essay totally agrees with this opinion because it is the morally correct thing to do and it will also help their economy in the long term.  \n\nRefugees are fleeing their homeland because of war and famine. This means that many of these people will die or come to serious harm if they are not accepted by western states and it is therefore moral imperative that they allow them in. That is  to say that if they do not shelter and feed them they would be responsible for many deaths and terrible suffering. For example, migrants from Syria are escaping a brutal war and this is the reason why Germany and other European countries have decided to grant hundreds of thousands of them asylum.  \n\nThousands of extra people coming into a country will also help boost the economy. This is because there will be more workers available and they will, in turn, pay tax and also buy goods and services in that country. They may need extra financial support in the beginning, but this will be paid back many times over if they stay and work. For example, millions of Vietnamese people were forced to leave their homeland in the 1970s and many of them have established thriving businesses in the USA which pay billions of dollars in tax every year.  \n\nIn conclusion, refugees should be accepted with open arms by countries in the western hemisphere because it is the right thing to do on moral grounds and it will also benefit the host countries monetarily in the future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some think that having ambition is a good quality. Is it important to be ambitious? Is it a positive or negative characteristic?\"\nEssay:\n\"Humans are greedy creatures. Nothing will be enough for them. Although, it is a good quality to possess. And they want to achieve more and more heights in their life. So, being ambitious is significantly important for everyone. They can surpass their own limit and prove their worth. However, being too ambitious in life also detrimental to them. In this essay, I will delineate its importance as well as its benefits and drawbacks.\n\nLife without a goal or an ambition to achieve something is like, running without direction. You are going nowhere. There is a difference between human beings and animals, and that is the goal to do something in life. We are nothing more than animals if one does not have such ambition in life. Also. if you decide to do something, and you are persistent about its success, you definitely achieve it. It does not matter if it is a small thing or a big one. The most important thing is that, you had an ambition and you did it. And that will boost your morale and confidence as well.\n\nOn the other hand, having an ambition in life has its advantages and adverse effects also. For instance, it is good for one to have a dream or desire to do something that will secure his/her future. And if they attain it, it will be beneficial to that individual. But, wasting precious years behind an ambition is foolishness. In addition, being over-ambitious also has a bad impact on an individual or on his family.\n\nTo recapitulate, everyone wants to attain heights in their life.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many students find it difficult to pay attention at school. What are the reasons for this? What could be done to solve this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"Due to increasing pressure and various other circumstances, children nowadays find it challenging to engage and concentrate on their academics at school. However, there are certain measures that can be taken to resolve this issue and make learning more fun and enjoyable for students. \n\nPrimarily, the lack of attention is due to the traditional teaching techniques followed by institutions. Passive teaching is sure to bore students rather than develop their talents since each student's grasping ability differs. The teachers are instructing students to memorise the answers instead of engaging in brainstorming and creative learning activities. The students rely on their memory and write the answer in the examination, which becomes the reason for frustration among the students. The use of portable devices such as mobile phones during lectures is another source of distraction. Instead of focusing on academics, students spend the majority of their time playing video games and surfing the internet. \n\nAlternatively, if instructors in schools use active learning techniques, in which each student is given the opportunity to exhibit what they have learned, students' learning will increase. Teachers should also use a variety of instructional strategies to pique students' interest and engagement, such as presenting videos, engaging through presentations, and personally contacting students. Finally, because distractions like video games and cell phones are the most prevalent cause of a child's lack of interest in studying, they should be banned in schools, and parents should impose a daily usage restriction on them. \n\nTo sum up, modern teaching techniques should be implemented in order to develop students' enthusiasm for learning and gadgets should be prohibited and limited because they tend to act as a barrier and reduce students' effectiveness\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi dung cau hoi de bai:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

I am going to shed some light on  this statement that there are more advantages than disadvantages.\n\nFirst of all, in the bustle and hustle of life, mankind who settle in the city get bombarded with numerous busy problems such as  terrible traffic. Thus, they can be less and less accessible to move in the rush hour. For example, an abundance of children have to eat junk food while they are stuck on the road, moreover, they spend their single hurry lives. So, to tackle this problem the government should pay  considerable attention to keeping their citizens free of housing trouble and they should prevent  mass transportation or business from being centred at a mere location. \n\nConsequently, to overcome this situation,  economic policy should play an important role to encourage  businesses to move to the rural area. Thus people living in other areas will enhance their quality of life because they are allowed to use more facilities such as shopping centres. Furthermore, an unbalanced financial will disappear since the merchant can make money from this investment. And for another, the spreading of the population can reduce  crime.\n\nTo conclude, from my perspective, this statement has more advantages than disadvantages. To counter these threats, not only the government but also the commerce should encourage the commercial everywhere.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai, neu ro quan diem ca nhan va tra loi cau hoi lieu loi ich co lon hon nhuoc diem khi chinh phu khuyen khich cac doanh nghiep di chuyen vao vung nong thon.

Some people think that education success mostly depends on teachers, while others argue that it depends more on the attitude of students and their willingness to study. In fact, I side with those who believe that academic success depends on the student's attitudes and abilities. \n\nOn the one hand, the teacher is the most important in academic success. It is believed that a good teacher will make the students better. Teachers can be easily role models for their pupils. By being role models, teachers can shape the students' characters. Students will listen easily to their teachers. For instance, students become more diligent because they love to learn with their favourite teachers at school. As a result, students can achieve academic success easily.\n\nOn the other hand, the attitudes of students and their willingness plays an essential part to be successful in academic. Many people believe that attitude can show how far the students have learned. Moreover, the ability to answer teacher questions correctly means they learn seriously and regularly. These habits will shape them to become disciplined and responsible. It will help them to get better scores at school. For illustration, pupils that review their material at home will get a better understanding of that subject. Consequently, pupils can be more competitive to get the best score.\n\nTo sum up, there are many ways to achieve academic success. However, many people believe that teachers become the most important part to make students good at school. Meanwhile, others argue that attitudes and abilities to answer teachers' questions are essential parts of gaining success in academics. I am firmly convinced that good attitudes and abilities play important roles in academic success.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi duoc cau hoi de bai mot cach day du.

In this particular essay, we will discuss why this event pretends to happen and the potential reason why some individuals may be reluctant to abandon the use of cash.\n\n\n\nIn this era, technology become developed. It may lead to behaviour shifts in several aspects of this life. One of the aspects that influenced is shopping behaviour amongst people. For example, the shifting of payment methods that will be used when people do shop. There will be a new payment method using cards or payment applications on a smartphone. This payment method can be called a cashless payment method. It will help people in more efficiently when bringing a thing during shopping.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are some people who may not agree with this new payment method. Several people who tend to not be happy with this event are coming from sellers. It is because there is a regulation from the government, that there will be extra charges for the store to the bank as a cashless payment fee. This extra charge most likely applied to the store ,not the customer. Stores will be facing a decrease in their revenue from this regulation.\n\n\n\nIn a nutshell, a shifting of payment methods from cash to cashless will happen in the future due to the development of technology. However, there are several people who come from sellers who might not agree with this shifting due to the extra charge that they need to pay to the bank.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"All over the world, the number of overweight people is growing. What do\n\n\n\nyou feel are the main causes of this? What are the effects?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this day, the worldwide percentage of obese people is rapidly increasing. Although often debated, a major cause is due to the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food choices. In this essay, a look at these causes and their effects will be made.\n\n\n\n   Firstly, the two most major reasons for obesity are due to the unhealthy lifestyle and diets with a lack of nutrients trends in the 21st century. For instance, a study conducted by the American obesity society found that the fast meal industry market has increased doubled since the 2000s. It can easily be seen when people have busy daily lives, they towards to choose easy lunches and dinners with fast foods and microwavable diets, which contain much fat and sugar content. Moreover, people don�t spend their time taking part in exercise in their daily lives. Thus, this lack of physical activities combined with processed food lead to  overweighting. \n\n\n\n   The effects of obesity are countless but a major one is that obesity leads to massive health problems. To illustrate, as evidenced in the United Kingdom, many scientists have pointed out that over 70 percent of fat people likely to face up with diseases such as heart failure, and diabetes, which are two of the leading causes of death. As a result, millions of dollars have been spent each year due to their diabetes and heart failure medications. Thus, it is clear that these effects need to be mostly decreased to reform the quality of life for future generations. \n\n\n\n   To conclude,  awareness and healthy food options, as well as, more social physical exercise are  significant ways to prevent  obesity. It is predicted that both schools and parents will encourage their children to have nourishing diets and follow  healthy lifestyle trends.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In today's world, obesity is becoming a big problem in many parts of the world. Recently, the number of obsessed people is increasing so fast that some suggest that, the main culprits like fast food and unhealthy food, needed to be taxed to discourage people from consuming too much. This essay will try to argue that increasing the price of junk food will not help people fight this obesity crisis.\n\n\n\nIn human history, obesity was never run rampant like this before. The obesity pandemic is a very modern problem, in the past, it is very hard to find poor people who were overweight in contrast to the present where most of the obsessed people come from low-income households. The main cause of this is that most of the time the only food these low-income people can afford is either low-quality and low-price fast food or heavily processed food that has low nutrition but high sugar and fat to compensate for the low-quality ingredient used to keep the price low. By levying the tax on junk food industries it will, in reality, make the problem much worse than it already is. If junk food increases in price then it will force people who can bearly afford to consume this already low-quality product to find the even lower-quality alternative.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, rather than put a tax on low-quality food it is better to spend money subsidizing or cutting taxes on healthy food options. If the root cause of obesity comes from overconsumption of low-quality consumption goods then the solution is to change the consumer choice. Since food is an essential part of life it is impossible to tell people to eat less expressly to those low-income who bearly scrape by even with low-cost fast food. Giving some incentives, like lowering taxes on healthier option products or subsidizing high-quality unprocessed ingredients, to fast food chains and food manufacturers to produce healthier products for the same price as the unhealthy product can help solve the overweight problem in the lower class who the most susceptible to the obesity pandemic.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion . For many people being obsessed didn't come from their personal choice but the lack of choices that cause them to resort to fattening food for sustenance. By giving those people a healthier affordable option, it will help them much more in the long term than to just increasing the prices of junk food which is their only option for food. And that is why I strongly disagree with increasing fast food prices as a solution to the obesity problem.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai voi quan diem rieng cua minh, nhung co mot so diem can cai thien va giai thich ro hon.\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Educating young people is naturally important. However, some think governments ought to invest more in education for adults in need. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed that youth is an asset for the country's development in the future, therefore it is genuinely important to build the adolescent�s knowledge. In the meantime, there is some opinion that stands for the government needs to be focused on educating adults who need education instead of the youth. From my perspective, I completely agree with the statement that we government need to invest more in elder education. In this particular essay, I will elaborate the consideration of my views.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, it needs to realize that number of education for adults could be low due to the limited access for them to pursue an education particularly in the previous decade with a minimum facility from the country, for instance in the rural area. Therefore, it leads them to the low opportunity for having a job that impacts their economy and they do not have enough money for their family. As an effect  As a result of this situation, they even can not they cannot afford to send their children to go to school. It will make the cycle of poverty in the family will revolves and perpetuate/continue/persist.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if there is a public policy on enlarging the opportunity for education access for the elderly. For example, an education to develop soft skills such as Reading, Basic Mathematics, and Basic Digital or Information Technology Education it will help them to broaden their competencies and can give them new skills which can be used for them to apply for a job since the opportunity to them will rise up because of the competencies that they have. Their life will be better than before, and they can fulfill their family�s primary needs because of the cash that they get from their jobs. This policy also can help to decrease the poverty number in the country.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, it is important for the government in investing the elder�s education access to help them have a good life for their family and so on. In addition, an opportunity for adults in getting knowledge can impact the country�s development in the case of poverty as well.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

In this essay, therefore, the reasons and the opinions will be discussed and the following example will be provided in order to support my point of view.\n\n\n\nIt is commonly believed that novelists and TV producers are attracting the reader and  viewers by exaggerating suspense scenes. From this sentence I will concentrate more on the TV shows that had a massive impact on people's imaginations because the producer utilises technological methods to attract them and make them feel curious, so they want to know more about what is happening next. Moreover, some stories are related to real life. For example, a couple lovers had been killed by a mysterious guy or stories about unbelievable massive accidents all around the world by well know scientists. Having said that, the entertainment from curious crime stories had  attracted more people to watch or read them.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, I believed that entertainment cush as films about crime dramas can have a major effect in different ways. For instance, mature will enjoy and learn from the movie that situations or circumstances might be happening so they will realise and be more different themself when it happens. However, children or less mature people might think that violence from TV is normal and they may manipulate it because they think humans from TV shows can do, so they can do the same as well.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, crime stories are popular and increasingly more viewers  watch  films. therefore, parents must supervise their children about pros and cons of  crime stories.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban phan nao tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that cultural traditions may be destroyed when they are used as money-making traditions aimed at tourists, others, however, believe that it is the only way to save these traditions. \n\n\n\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"The tourism industry is an essential part of Vietnam's total GDP. To develop it further, travel agents have utilized all their means to create new experiences. But in the process, there have been some hot debates about whether or not commercializing cultural traditions is a sensible decision. In my opinion, both views have their legitimate reasons.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, the continuous expansion of tourism has several consequences. The first negative effect is that heritage sites and monuments are jam-packed with tourists, causing damage to them. For instance, the influx of tourists in the ancient town of Hoi An carved their names on the walls, which vandalized the historical landmark. Moreover, the uncontrolled development of tourism can deteriorate the environment and threaten wildlife. A simple example is Nha Trang beach with garbage floating all over its coast, causing loss of scenery, water pollution, and harm to marine life.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that putting a price on cultural tours is the only method to keep them from fading away. First, revenue from sightseeing, art performances, and other tourist activities is used largely for restoration efforts. Without enough financial support, various attraction sites may fall into disrepair. Another reason is that tourism helps promote cultural exchange. Tourists can visit many historical significance places and talk to local people to gain an in-depth understanding about the area's culture. This encourages the revival of traditions and elevates cultural values.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, it is beyond doubt that developing tourism brings both positive and negative impacts. Governments and authorities should not lose sight of this fact before deciding on expanding the tourism industry.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Small businesses are disappearing and being replaced by large multinational companie. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern era, well know associations run all kinds of employment and reach  the peak of success as compared to small or unestablished trade. I think advantages are more than disadvantages. \n\n\n\nOn the one hand, employment opportunities are increased because of  the establishment of big companies. They need more well-educated people to run different businesses. As well as appoint less experience communities in different positions ,for example, janitorial staff, and cafeteria staff. The second benefit is eligible people get an opportunity to prove themselves through their work and share their skills with other people, who have less experience. For example; if the person who works as an accountant has an issue solving problem related to Social issues, he or she can get help from the other person who has experience in the Social field. The third benefit is to contribute to the development of the country because we all know that business reflects the economy of the country. Big companies have approached to settle down their relations with other countries. For example, business partnerships with other companies.\n\n\n\n  On the other hand, with the development of multi-national companies people get attracted and start to ignore private businesses for example; people start  buying vegetables and all household items from the grocery store rather than street vendors so the street vendors feel helpless and shut down their business. Secondly, life will be harder for illustrate people because they do not have the basic education and resources which they require to run big companies as compared to educated people. for instance; an educated person can run any kind of business but a person who has no knowledge of business survives in poverty.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Overall big companies provide better opportunities for employment as well as better future options.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi day du cau hoi de bai va mo rong y tuong la hai yeu to quan trong de dat duoc diem cao trong tieu chi Task Response.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising but not the real need of the society where such products are sold. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is considered that increasing the supply of some famous consumable item which was actually not in demand can be achieved with the influence of advertisement. I completely agree with this concept because an interesting presentation creates curiosity and most people fall for it despite the real cost-benefit-need analysis. In this essay, we will see how it works with some examples.\n\n\n\nFirstly,  advertisements create an interactive interface in a person's mind and when they are interesting and relevant by any means induce desire. In my hometown, people are fond of making a special sweet called Khasta as it is a household name and included in everyday meals. Citizens use traditional equipment made of wood to shape it as shaping with hands is tedious and time-consuming. A famous Kitchen utensil manufacturer developed the same device out of steel and brought it into the market but was unsuccessful. Then they began advertising after 3 years of product lunch and soon their sales tripled the following year. But soon the habitats realized that the sweet was missing in taste, texture and durability. \n\n\n\nLater, after numerous consumer complaints, the local government began to investigate. when the inspection was completed it was found that there was no problem with the manufacturer's equipment but it was the wood which rich the taste. The report says  it was the specific wood which has a unique compound called \"bibi\" in the local language which adds flavour to the sweet and was responsible for the preservation for a longer duration whereas the steel lacks that. Moreover, the tree was locally inhabited so the multinational manufacturer had no knowledge about it. They found that the product is very popular in other states however so, it would be an easy go, it did but did not prolong.\n\n\n\nOverall, the power of advertisement does increase sales in the market where there is no demand but how long the demand lasts is completely dependent on the consumer. Hence, I would suggest making proper research on the actual practice of the habitats before launching the device into the market.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai bang cach dong y rang quang cao tac dong den viec tieu thu cua nguoi tieu dung.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Environmental problems such as pollution and climatic variations are increasing nowadays. The governments have taken some measures at a global level. But they got only few solutions. Why is it so? How can this be solved?\"\nEssay:\n\"Pollution and climate change are going up every day. Moreover, governments are offering solutions that are not effective on a worldwide scale. In this essay, I will explain the reasons behind this and provide some potential solutions.\n\n\n\nIf we compare the world now to 100 years ago, we can identify the problem. In the past, people lived in rural areas and consumed what they grew. However, after the industrial revolution, more communities migrated to cities and their habits shifted from being producers to consumers. Companies now strive to sell their products in order to increase their wealth, and governments do not have the authority to limit them, so even in developed countries this problem remained as it was. Additionally, the media industry and the internet assist companies in reaching customers worldwide. Resulting in increased use of fossil fuel products delivery. For instance, wooden types of furniture can produce in any country, but for the sake of advertisements, imported type is used.\n\n\n\nAnother issue is the encouragement of excessive consumption. In the past one car was sufficient for a family, but now it has become common for each person to own their own car. With the increasing human population on Earth, the need for food is undeniable. As a result, organizations are employing conservation and other production techniques to produce and store food for longer periods of time or cutting trees of jungles to build construction for industrial reasons. However, this leads to the use of more industrial machines, facilities and pesticides in agriculture. While there are benefits to these practices, associations often use excessive amounts of water and pollute it before returning to nature. For example, in my country, one of the most well-known companies is a major contributor to water pollution as they release dirty water into rivers, and the government cannot do anything about it.\n\n\n\nIn summary, these changes are inevitable, but humans are accelerating them. The only way to slow down these changes is by teaching people to love the Earth like other creatures in the world.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDa, bai viet cua ban de cap den cac van de moi truong nhu o nhiem va bien doi khi hau tang len moi ngay va su khong hieu qua cua cac bien phap chong lai nhung van de nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"All cars that burn fossil fuels should be banned and electric cars should replace them. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In today's interconnected world environmental pollution especially, four-wheelers are causes great damage to our planet in multiple ways, and to reduce this, Government should create a policy or a strategy of bringing electric transportation which is proven to efficient. I agree with the above-mentioned statement. Electric cars are more eco-friendly, and people can save money on petrol.\n\n\n\nFirstly, electric cars are environmentally friendly. Moreover, they don�t produce any kind of pollution which would affect our planet besides, they don�t need any kind of fuel to run. Therefore, they contribute to lower air pollution. Additionally, this kind of transport operates more quietly than traditional cars, reducing noise pollution. Hence, helps combat climate change and improve air quality. For example, instead of using traditional cars for those who deliver products to nearby areas such as Pizza, groceries, and other petty companies, promoting electric cars for deliveries can save enormous savings to them.\n\n\n\nSecondly, these types of vehicles bring cost savings. As we discussed, in the first paragraph, they have lower operating cost compared to petrol cars, they are more predictable and non-fluctuating like petrol prices. Furthermore, the maintenance cost is very less, and their wear and tear are less frequent compared to other cars. Besides, we can have our own solar charger installed at home, and no need to go outside for charging the car. For example, Governments around the world offer rebates and incentives or grants to promote the adoption of these vehicles. Therefore, taking these advantages can bring significant cost savings.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, yes, I strongly agree that banning petrol and diesel cars would benefit and as mentioned above EVs are the most eco-friendly, improve air quality and reduce noise pollution. Additionally, they bring long-term cost savings too.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, ban da dong y rang tat ca cac xe chay bang nhien lieu hoa thach nen bi cam va nen thay the bang cac xe dien.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The international community must act immediately to ensure all nations to reduce their consumption of fossil fuels e.g gas and oil. Do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent days, fossil fuels such as gas, oil and coal have declined nature alarming to all countries find alternatives to reduce their use. In my opinion, firmly agree with the notion because excessive use is harmful to humans and also animals. I will discuss the effects of fossil fuels in the ensuing paragraphs. \n\n\n\nTo begin with, there are numerous negative effects of the usage of fossil fuels. The combustion of gas produces a toxic substance of carbon dioxide which directly affects living creatures and causing of climate change. The weather these days is unpredictable because of climate change. Moreover, ozone depletion creates a cause of climate change. In other words, UV rays are direct reflect on the Earth which leads to skin cancer in the human body.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the international community promote  all  nations to reduce the usage of fossil fuels because the prominent reason that  is non-renewable energy or fuels in the near future,  will be extinct. Hence, these authorities suggest that find alternative options instead of fossil fuels. For example, the prime mister of India promotes electrical vehicles which save non-renewable energy. The survey by the Environment Department predicted that in Saudi Arabia, the production of gasoline and oil would decline in 2025 and the country no longer be able to export.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the main cause of air pollution which creates by non-renewable sources. Consequently, all countries must work together to prevent the further depletion of fossil fuels and find alternative ways.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, toi danh gia rang ban da tra loi dung cau hoi va dong y voi viec can giam tieu thu nhien lieu hoa thach.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, as women and men have to work full time, household duties should be equally divided. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this modern era, there is a conflict regarding household duties as men and women both have to divide the chores equally among them. It is quite significant to notice that  women are the backbone of their families so there should be some equality and justice for them also. I totally agree with this statement that the job at home should be proportionally divided among both which will be discussed further in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, in earlier times only the males were the breadwinner for the family, however, nowadays, both  genders are working equally to earn for the family. Therefore, both should task together on the household schedule instead of throwing a woman in the kitchen after those long hours of working outside. For instance, they can divide the work according to their interest or also for odd-even days which will give a kind of relief to a woman too. Not only that, females are the ones who take care of their children. Nevertheless, makes are equal parents of the child so they should also take care of them by investing time in their study or play. \n\n\n\nMoving further, women are physically not that much stronger than men, then what is the logic behind forcing them to task alone at home? Unfortunately, ladies are considered as labour force so they are supposed to work the whole day no matter what is their strength as compared to another gender. Even though they are the ones who suffer from the natural cycle each month but who cares. Instead of making them suffer from all these situations, men as well as society have to understand their condition and let them work proportionally at home as compared to men.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, males and ladies should be considered equal in every hemisphere and if it is about working at the house then they should divide the chores equally. Females are also working outside with men to run the family and they are contributing equally as well. So instead of being physically and emotionally ,weaker they are taking care of household chores which should be divided same among them.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

Other people believe that a world population increase is necessary and beneficial as it creates the growth of the world�s economy and society.\n\n\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"The World has witnessed a dramatic increase in the population in different parts of the earth. Some people believe that due to this, many parts of the world will encounter a global crisis. Others feel that population is needed for boosting the economy of any country and society. This essay will elucidate both views with relevant examples.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, various areas of the world face a crisis of basic amenities due to scarcity of resources and overcrowding. This is possibly due to underdevelopment and a nonproductive workforce. For example, a region's growth is directly proportional to the intelligent and smart youth. If they are not fruitful, they will not grow to the intended level.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, many developed countries require genius people to take care of many firms they have come up with. Moreover, it is of paramount importance that companies do well in terms of production that can be sent to those needy to fetch a reasonable amount of money. For instance, a country producing abundant amounts of grains can be exported to those where it is intensely short of it. This could be due to unfavourable conditions in the country that prevent them from cultivating it. Hence, they rely on getting them imported. To do all these in a sophisticated manner, sensible manpower is required.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, I would say overcrowding could be a question  when it comes to managing the population ; however, it is very essential to have accountable people to take care of the developed things within to ensure well earning.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban dung yeu cau va tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve viec thao luan ca hai quan diem: mot so nguoi tin rang tang dan so toan cau khong ben vung va se dan den khung hoang toan cau, trong khi nguoi khac tin rang tang dan so la can thiet va co loi cho su phat trien kinh te va xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some countries have introduced laws to limit the working hours that an employer can ask from an employee.\n\n\n\nWhy are these law introduced?\n\n\n\nIs this a positive or negative trend?\"\nEssay:\n\"In a few nations, it has become a trend of more working hours. In my opinion, such a type of labour law will stop exploitation and will have a positive impact on the workers.\n\n\n\nThere are several reasons behind the long working duties. Mainly, the invention of new technologies keeps employees busy even after their daily office time.For example, it is too easy to be in touch with your clients through notifications on the smartphone or e-mail. It is mandatory for some higher-level person to reply to it. Secondly, during industrial, expansion  employers take advantage of needy employees and push them to work for 12-14 hours as a slave, and if they deny they may suffer from job loss or maybe  financial issues.\n\n\n\nThe implementation of the limited working time law offers a worker to have a mental, physical and social pace. Like, factory workers hardly get moments to spend with their families as they suppose to stay on the same premise after long duties. The limited engagement of work will help them to spend a good time with their family which leads to strong family life. To continue, in such countries where there are no rules of labour time forces too manpower in physical exploitation especially with child labour.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, the need for laws related to controlling working hours occurs because of new inventions and unlimited greed. By introducing, law it becomes easy to develop both a mental and social environment in the country by considering its own perspective.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da phat trien y kien cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some cities have vehicle-free days when private cars, trucks and motorcycle are banned from the city centre. People are encouraged to use public transport such as buses, taxies and metro on vehicle-free day. To what extent do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"Today, people have a variety of vehicle options to go  anywhere. However, these vehicles lead to some environmental problems such as air pollution, global warming, climate change and so on. Therefore, people need a comprehensive plan to address the results of using vehicles. Some cities have vehicle-free days to promote the use of public transport. In my opinion, despite some obvious drawbacks which should not be overlooked, I think the benefits of a vehicle-free day outweigh.\n\n\n\nThe advantages of using public transport should be taken into consideration. The major benefit of using public transport which should be initially referred to is that people can be more healthy and problems in the field of environment reduce sharply. Vehicle pollutants harm our health and contain greenhouse gases that cause climate change. If people are unaware of climate change possibility, they will face its results which are famine, drought, and flooding. For instance, a survey found that more than 45% of people living in cities which are not used public transport have more risk to be asthma and breathing difficulties because of toxic gases.\n\n\n\nAnother significant advantage of using public transport is that it helps to protect nonrenewable energy resources which as oil. Due to the ever-increasing number of people, nonrenewable energy resources reduce dramatically. However, people need these energy resources because they are energy-rich and relatively cheap to process. For this reason, thanks to vehicle-free days, people can be aware of the detrimental effects of oil consumption.\n\n\n\nTo sum up, vehicle-free days are beneficial to prevent mentioned above adverse effects of using private vehicles.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va nhan manh rang loi ich cua mot ngay khong xe la vuot troi hon so voi nhuoc diem.

This essay will examine the roots and possible solutions to maintain this concern.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, There are several reasons for people struggling with nervousness due to financial barriers. First of all, It is evident to everybody that working conditions have become more complicated, and this situation has led to confined employees to their job in order to keep their job secure. Furthermore, life expenses have become a principal dilemma among folks. They should afford the cost of rent, installments, or even unforeseen expenses like disease treatment.

For instance, employers can offer some promotions based on employees' competency. Employers can consider a program for employees in which they can raise their salary if they have some proposals in order to enhance company income.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people think that it is effective for students to study in a group at school, while others think it is better to study alone. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is often argued by some individuals that group study is more efficacious for pupils, while others are of the opinion that it is better for them to study on their own. In this essay, I will outline arguments for and against the method of study and I will state my viewpoint on this issue.\n\n\n\nTo commence with, the majority of people are convinced that it provides positive impacts for pupils to do group-based study at school. To express it more plainly, the shared study approach motivates students to take part in discussions and find  solutions by brainstorming with one another which really makes the study process fun and interesting. Not only are the students encouraged to be more active, but also they learn teamwork as well as other social skills. To give an instance, Although some courses were too boring and tedious for me during university, I found out that by collaborative learning with other students, I can make them too entertaining and get good grades as group study avoid us to be tired.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are some individuals who opine that it is advantageous for students to study lonely. To put it another way, they believe that pupils must be able to analyze  scientific subjects alone to learn  problem-solution skills. For instance, some surveys and research showed that students who sued to study alone usually have better capabilities to come up with difficulties and are able to control hard situations. Moreover, they can be better tutors in future too. \n\n\n\nIn my opinion, both methods are advantageous for students provided that they opt for one of the correct methods regarding their interests and the characteristics of the courses. I myself found both of them applicable during school and university. \n\n\n\nTo conclude, both group study and study alone have their own advantages such as motivating students and strengthening problem solution skills of pupils, respectively.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong khi ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve y kien   cua cac nhom ve phuong phap hoc nhom va hoc mot minh, nhung ban can phat trien y tuong cua minh cu the hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many people say that globalization and the growing number of multinational companies have a negative effect on the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.\"\nEssay:\n\"In recent years, globalization and multinational companies have grown rapidly, and some people argue that they have drawbacks for the environment. I entirely agree with this statement due to the increasing amount of gas emissions and decreasing green spaces that I will discuss in this essay.\n\n\n\nFirst, the growth of globalization makes it easier for people to travel anywhere and anytime; however, it can effect the environment due to the increasing amount of gas emissions. Most people prefer to commute by using their private vehicles or an airplane if they go aboard. As a consequence, using those transport modes can result in gas emissions, which can destroy our environment. For example, the top executive managers in big companies who have several offices in different countries will use airplanes and private cars when they have meeting agendas in different locations. These vehicles produce much more gas emissions when they travel frequently, which will affect our environment. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, the expansion of multinational companies also has an effect on the environment, especially our green spaces, which are decreasing. When multinational companies will expand their businesses or factories in other places, it directly affects the green ecosystem environment, which is decreasing in forest and woodland areas. The natural balance is also disturbed. For instance, Nestle company has several branch offices and factories in various countries, and this takes up a lot of land in many countries. As a result, green spaces are decreasing as this company continues to expand its businesses and factories in other countries.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that globalization and the increasing number of multinational companies have a negative effect on the environment due to the fact that increasing gas emissions and green space issues.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach dong y voi quan diem rang toan cau hoa va cac cong ty da quoc gia co tac dong tieu cuc den moi truong.\n- Tuy nhien, ban co the phat trien y tuong cua minh mot cach day du hon bang cach:\n  + Dua ra su lien ket giua toan cau hoa va tang luong khi thai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, However, think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In the present time, individuals around the world take the view that routine is preferable to any changes. In contrast, others believe that change has a beneficial role in our lives. The objective of this essay is to discuss both of this and give my own perspective with relevant examples in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n\nTo embark with, many people avoid changes because they might like being stable without unnecessary changes. For instance, people who want to spend their lives  pursuing a single career path without any promotions. Moreover, one of the reasons why individuals tend to do this due to their fear and  not being willing to take a risk. Such risks as losing a job or hatred from colleagues. This is the most habitual for the Japanese population. Their cultural beliefs and traditions do not allow such behaviour where workers ask for a promotion. It is thought to be rude by the Japanese society. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, others advocate that changes are important and always have positive effects on a person and his surroundings. In other words, without change individuals can not reach their pinnacle and aim. Also, it was proven by scientists that a person who tends to change has  more changes to stay mentally health. That is because when people expand their knowledge and learn about new activities which are unusual for them, the brain  activates neurons to cope with difficulties. Therefore, these actions are connected with human change by implication. As a result, change has a positive impact on individuals' development and mental health. \n\n\n\nTo sum up, there are two opinions, those who appreciate change and those who do not. Change has an important function in developing the brain and personality. However, some societies do not prefer change due to their culture and tradition.  From my own perspective, change matters, and being flexible is much more important nowadays than ever.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban co phan anh dung ca hai quan diem trong cau hoi va ban da cho y kien cua minh vao cuoi bai viet.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that parents should encourage their children to take part in\n\n\n\norganised group activities in their free time. Others say that it is important for\n\n\n\nchildren to team how to occupy themselves on their own.\n\n\n\nDiscuss both these views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Some family heads argue that young children should participate in social settings rather than engage in individual activities. This essay will discuss both views and why I think it is essential to mingle with others.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, parents choose to let their children carry out free time activities on their own to develop independence. When children work independently, they acquire skills that will be useful for their future such as being able to solve problems. Furthermore, not having to spend time with a lot of people allows them to avoid disagreements with friends. Children find it easier to play online games than to go out to the park. Therefore, parents desire their children to stay home and do what they love on their own.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, research indicates that collaboration between young children enhances social and confidence skills. First, as young youths do things with their mates, they develop good communication skills by initiating and contributing to conversations. Hence, in future when they are young adults, they are prepared to face the challenges that come with working with different people. For example, as they participate in group settings, they become capable communicators and learn from other people's perspectives. Secondly, spending time with peers' supports the development of confidence. This is achieved when youths share ideas and extend on them, as a result, they build on their self-esteem knowing that their thoughts are valued. Therefore,  it is important that children should get out of their comfort zone and meet people to strengthen life's essential skills such as social and confidence skills.\n\n\n\nIn summary, some people think children should spend time on their own, while others think they should socialise. I think the latter is essential because it helps with skills for social life and confidence.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da cung cap cac y tuong de mo rong quan diem cua ban.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many historical sites and museums are mainly  visited by tourists, not local people. Why is this the case? What can be done to attract local people  to visit this historical  sites and museums?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that most historical sites and museums attract a larger number of tourists; however, local people are less interested. In my opinion, there are numerous reasons for this trend. I will discuss the reason and also give a solution in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, people are bored visiting such places. In other words, local citizens know about their own cities therefore, it is not new for them. Hence, they think that such visits are a waste of time. However, tourists are very excited to explore new things in their destinations. Museums and  historical sites will help to understand the history and culture of the countries they visit. Another reason is that these types of places tickets are very expensive. If people visited once that they would not pay the higher entrance fees.\n\n\n\nIn addition, there are several solutions to these situations. Firstly, the government should organise campaigns to attract the local public such as free education seminars, health care camps and other programs which will attract. Moreover, the authority of such places gives extra discounts or is free for locals. So that, low and middle-income families can visit. For example, schools or colleges give assignments to the student related to history and they interact with historical places. Lastly, the organisation give more and more job opportunity to the local public. Hence, they work in such places and pursue more knowledge about history.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the government can encourage more locals by running interesting programs such as exhibits at these locations and offering free or subsidized entry.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va cung cap y tuong de giai quyet van de thu hut nguoi dia phuong tham quan di tich lich su va bao tang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Water is a natural resource that should always be free. Governments should embargo the sale of bottled water.\n\n\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is argued by some individuals that government should restrict the sale of bottled water as water is a natural resource, and it should always be free of cost. However, I have a complete disagreement with this notion \n\n\n\nTo begin with, I believe free water facilities should only be free for people in public places, remote areas, or slum areas so that people can get clean, drinkable water free of charge. For example, in Indian villages and public places, railway stations, parks, and bazaars, clear tap water is viable for residents.  But, for residential or commercial use in cities or towns, For instance, in India, city authorities charge monthly water bills for water supplies. This method has discouraged civilians from wasting water. Nevertheless, some years ago, when tap water was free, per capita water utilization was considerably higher in urban areas.\n\n\n\nNowadays, the sale of bottled water is increasing significantly across the world and there are some specific reasons why  it should not be banned. Firstly, before packing water in bottles, it is properly purified so that it does impact the consumers. In other words, water purification standards are met by companies becoming water bottled, while in some countries, like India, Public tap water is too polluted and can cause health issues hence people avoid even free water and prepared packed water for drinking. Secondly, the suggestion of banning packed water would not be accepted by companies and the government would face agitation, if they go for implementing it. Because this decision will adversely impact the earnings of the bottled water business. Hence it is practically impossible to stop the sales of bottled water.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I believe that government should not put restrictions on the sale of bottled water and even it is difficult to impossible to make it free for every individual.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTra loi yeu cau cua task response (phan hoi yeu cau de bai) la mot yeu to quan trong trong viec danh gia bai viet.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that team sports are very important for children to succeed in their career, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern era, the majority of students are occupied with their academic lives and find little time for external sports activities, which are vital to their overall development.Some individuals believe that it is imperative that children participate in club athletics, while others disagree.In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and offer my opinion.\n\n\n\nInitially, athletics is essential to the physical and mental development of children. To live a happy and successful life in a world where the majority of adolescents remain indoors after school or spend the majority of their time on mobile devices or viewing television, thereby negatively affecting their health, is to engage in some form of athletic activity. Group sports teach them how to collaborate in a club setting.In addition, they have the opportunity to develop leadership abilities by serving as team leaders.Lastly, how to motivate team members in low morale situations and maintain team coordination. In a recent survey conducted by the sports council of India, it was found that teenagers who perform sports concurrently with their education have greater stamina, focus, and concentration than their peers.\n\n\n\nOpponents of group sports, on the other hand, argue that there is no need for group sports because it is a waste of time that could be spent on the academic front.Then, sometimes the leader always receives recognition for the team's overall performance, and talented youths are never given the opportunity to advance.In addition, they lose their study focus and spend the majority of their time performing sports.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, after weighing the pros and cons, I am of the opinion that club sports are crucial to the success of children's careers and that they should participate in some form of physical activity.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response trong bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"News stories on TV and in newspapers are very often accompanied by pictures. Some people say that these pictures are more effective than words.\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern world, photographs play a great role compared to the past. It is always a topic of discussion whether images are effective in comparison with written information or not. I will discuss this and share my opinion in the following paragraphs about these two factors.\n\n\n\nTo begin with, pictures portray a detailed explanation. For instance, a recent study of a few Indian neurologists organized a free analysis of the young generation. Under that, a few youngsters were shown certain historical images and others were given scriptures for the same pictures after a couple of hours, a few questions were asked of both groups to test them, and they found unimaginable data. Those who were shown images, were able to recall most of the data and were clear with what they saw under images, compared to 2nd group who were only able to remember a few things.    \n\n\n\nSecondly, compared to written or visual, a shot can bring more attention and better understanding.  \n\n\n\nAnother study, which is recently published by WHO scientist Roger Federer showed that humans are more capable of remembering pictures or videos compared to written information. After hearing this data, the Indian government has decided to change the way of educating and most prominently the small kids by adding more pictures & videos along with less written information in their syllabus because it is really easy to make children understand the facts and figures.\n\n\n\nTo conclude, images and drawings are more productive than written data, furthermore, this is really important to have great memories and keep humans grateful.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi mot phan yeu cau de bai bang viec de cap den viec hinh anh co hieu qua hon tu ngu.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Individuals should not be allowed to carry guns as it increases crime and violence in society.\n\n\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree\"\nEssay:\n\"In the contemporary world, although people's safety takes first priority, a school of thought holds that guns, which are actually self-defence for many residents, should be banned utterly in daily life. From my perspective, I totally concur with this tendency, as it provides multiple benefits, especially in violence and crime rates, besides some other methods to ensure people's life and health. All of them will be clarified thoroughly through this essay.\n\n\n\nInitially, it is undeniable that guns, when being used by crime elements, ranging from thieves, robbers, gangsters, murder and so on,  become a bad thing, which put a higher risk in citizens whenever they leave their houses. Moreover, owning weapons as a defence method sometimes motivate peoples to choose violent ways when facing any issues. For instance, accommodating guns while having troubles when people's brains become impressively angry and unconscious can lead to regretful consequences, as many investigators have pointed out that people are inclined to solve problems due to their emotions more than their minds.\n\n\n\nBesides several reasons for prohibiting  bringing guns everywhere in towns, there are many substituted methods to replace this. Firstly, there should be more investment in security guards and safety management. Gaining people's trust is often seen as a more effective and feasible way to protect human life. Secondly, raising people's awareness through some propaganda classes and educating people in the right way might help to solve this issue.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, it will be dangerous for people and others to carry guns whenever hanging out. This tendency should be deleted utterly in everyone's opinion\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, de cap den quan diem cua minh ve viec cam nguoi dan mang sung va dong y hoan toan voi quan diem nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, people have greater access to fast food. Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages\"\nEssay:\n\"These days, as a result of the advent of technology in food making industry, a huge range of fast food become easily available and accessible to anyone. This, may include under-age people. Although there might be some benefits of the massive availability of fast meals, I believe that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\n\n\n\nTo embark on, it is true that many working parents nowadays are dependent on processed food for preparing daily meals for their families. The reason for this is that processed foods are easy to be prepared and also taste good. As a result, these parents will have more time to do other important jobs or errands. However, studies show that consuming an excessive amount of junk food has an appalling effect on our bodies. First, fast foods or processed foods have been processed through several steps before it served to the consumers. This means that essential nutrients are already cooked away and gone. This will be particularly dangerous for children as they may not receive the nutrients necessary for their growth. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, fast food contains a high levels of fats, calories and sugar that negatively affect our body in the long term. A study reveals that  unhealthy eating habit is one of the significant risk factors for chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. These diseases are  the highest causes of death in The US and worldwide.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, although fast food may be efficient, easy to prepare and taste good, we have to limit the consumption of this kind of food as it can have serious negative effects on our bodies.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people fail in school, but end up being successful in life.\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that is the case?\n\n\n\nWhat is the most important thing to succeed in life\"\nEssay:\n\"There is a typical case that someone who got a terrible score in school obtained remarkable achievements in their life. I think that finding a favourite job is the key to success, which directly causes this situation mentioned before. \n\n\n\nOn the one hand, we have to recognize that customized subjects in school provide students with fewer choices, leading them to hardly dig out their actual interests. For instance, a high school always teach   teenagers some normal lessons such as math, history, science, and so on. Meanwhile, students struggle in getting good scores in the examination and thus fail to explore the thing which matches their interests and talent. Therefore, it is reasonable that some people got a lower rank in school.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, society offers people more chance to seek their preferred job and career, which bring those who failed in their school life success. When people find things they are interested in, they tend to gain significant energy and self-satisfaction, making them take a giant step in life. Take finding a job as an example, people who are satisfied with their current job have a greater possibility of getting promoted and a big salary increment than those who lose interest in their job since they are willing to work hard in the company. Hence, people who get a favourite job and work in a suitable atmosphere tend to be successful.\n\n\n\nAlthough some factors are able to create success in people's life, I consider that gaining the favourite position is the most important thing to succeed in life\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi cau hoi de bai nhung co the can mo rong y tuong de dam bao rang noi dung cua ban du chi tiet va sau sac.

In my opinion, I consider that design and slogans play a major role to attract many consumers and they have a positive impact on the profit of enterprises.\n\nOne reason is that some businesses work so hard to promote their products or services to a large number of customers in a new method in order to increase their profits. In other words, the main purpose of companies is soaring their sales by promoting their products with a unique design that includes a specific colour in order to attract more customers. They prefer to see something stylish since some aspects of modern life are tedious. The sales consequently will increase gradually.\n\nAnother compelling reason why some businesses choose to advertise their services with a new strategy is that they focus more on a large number of people as soon as to buy their products than others for the same purposes. That is to say, nowadays, major companies offer many employment prospects in the marketing field as soon as to come up with subtle slogans that can attract consumers to purchase their products. They choose a slogan that is  amazing and it attracts the attention of consumers everywhere and anytime. For example, a taxi driver can be attracted by a nice and simple slogan even if he does not see the adverts of the product on television or on social media.\n\nFinally, in my view, I think that individuals support companies that advertise their products in a new and attractive approach. When enterprises do a lot of efforts to reach the majority of the community, they will encourage and impulse people to buy their products significantly. Using new formats to promote products as a result brings more financial outcomes for companies.\n\nIn conclusion, offering their products in a new way by altering their designs and slogans are definitely advantageous for the purpose of lifting up the profit of the companies and attracting many customers. Businesses should work on the design and slogan of their products because consumers appreciate  creativity.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung yeu cau cua de bai.

But constant availability of any information worsens people's memory and critical thinking skills.\n\n    To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"In this cutting-edge technological era, the internet is being used by a lot of individuals. However easy access has made analytical minds disappear although it also helps make tasks easier. I will elaborate on this in forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, there are many drawbacks to the Internet. People who use the internet are becoming dependent upon it. There are many platforms where solutions could be found for almost any situation. What one needs to do is just put some keywords and information would appear on the screen. So commuters do not need to make any research they can just copy the answer and paste it anywhere. For instance, chat GPT is an online platform which can leave many workers jobless in the future as teachers are being replaced by the internet.\n\nMoving to the benefits of the internet, it has made life easier. Information about almost everything is available just a click away. No one needs to study for hours to get to the conclusion. There are simple ways to solve problems, so no need to go to the traditional routes or formulae. For example, tasks could be done just by putting the equation and the answer will be there just in seconds or less, if asked what is pie, the web will show results and tell the source behind it.\n\nTo conclude, there are indeed detrimental to almost everything.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"People are living longer. Some people think that it causes big problems. Others, however, think the ageing population has many advantages for business, government and for society in general. Discuss both views & give your own opinion\"\nEssay:\n\"Due to the consecutive development of the standard of living, an average person’s lifespan is lengthened. However, it has led to the state of an ageing population which is considered either to cause issues for authorities or to benefit the society. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of having an ageing citizen and through this essay, I will analyse the reasons for this assertion.  \n\nTo begin with, a shortage in the young label force could be seen as one of the gravest drawbacks to a country owning an ageing community. The dramatic decrease in the number of young dwellers has resulted in a reduction in the total of newborn babies per year. Alongside that, the elderly tend to avoid giving birth to an infant because their body can not accommodate the conditions of bearing a foetus. Therefore, there will be fewer options for the recruitment agency. Following that, the deficiency of new workers will deteriorate the country’s economy. As industries require many employees with youthful strength and commitment to serve the needs of humanity. For instance, the service industry demands an immense volume of workers to operate.\n\nBesides, the ageing population also pressurises the economy with a tremendous amount of retirement pensions. As mentioned above, there are not enough staff which means that there will be no profits for the country’s income. The potential of a country is evaluated through their workforce and economic sustainability. Not only in a shortage of money and being unable to pay for the social welfare but the nation also can not call for foreign investments. Therefore, the opportunities for country innovation in every area will decline without the help of other nations.\n\nIn a nutshell, I believe that the drawbacks of an ageing population surpass the advantages of the effect of the old-aged workforce and the burden on the country’s economy.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDay la mot danh gia chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve viec xem xet ca hai quan diem ve loi ich va han che cua dan so gia hoa.\n- Tuy nhien, y tuong cua ban chua duoc mo rong day du de thuc day dong luc trong suy nghi cua nguoi doc.\n\nDe cai thien Task Response:\n- Thay vi chi dua ra nhung y chung chung ve nhung han che cua dan so gia hoa, ban nen trinh bay cac y kien cu the hon va cung cap vi du minh hoa de giai thich y kien cua minh.\n- Ban co the de cap den cac van de nhu tinh trang suy giam nguon nhan luc tre, su tang dang ke ve chi phi cham soc suc khoe va huu tri, su anh huong den quy huu tri va nguon luc tai chinh chung cua xa hoi va nhung kho khan trong viec duy tri su phat trien va doi moi kinh te.\n\nMong rang phan danh gia nay se giup ban nam bat diem yeu cua bai viet cua minh va cai thien no thanh mot bai viet xuat sac hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In many part of the world, children are given more freedom than in the past. Is this a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, in many societies, the youth have access to more freedom compared to the past. Whilst there are some drawbacks associated with this availability, I believe the main benefits are more substantial.\n\nOn one hand, the primary advantage of having more freedom is that giving permission utilizing up-to-the-minute gadgets leads to the privilege of having access to higher education sources and reinforcing their knowledge. In addition, having access to technology not only provides teenagers with a wide range of information to enhance their knowledge but also plays an important role in order to find their passion for a specific subject which can be their future job. For example, some channels on YouTube can be highly beneficial for children to learn more about a particular subject which used to be unavailable. A further benefit of freedom is that the youngsters have the opportunity to express their opinions which brings about a greater development in their personalities and more self-confidence as well. For instance, children who have been asked about their ideas feel more invaluable and have a chance to accelerate their maturity process.\n\nOn the other hand, giving freedom excessively can give rise to facing major problems. One disadvantage of freedom is that youngsters are more likely to be threatened by consuming cigarettes or other harmful drugs. Therefore, parents should allocate their children and raise their awareness about the detrimental effects of these behaviours. Another negative point of giving freedom is that teenagers can be prone to some dangerous tasks which can bring about vital issues. For example, being allowed to drive under the legal age may be prone for society.\n\nOn balance, it is true that giving freedom would seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances. However, in my view, its positive influences in terms of access to greater education and boosting their self-confidence outweigh the disadvantages.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va dua ra y tuong ve ca loi va hai cua viec tre em duoc co quyen tu do nhieu hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some children spen hours every day on their smartphones. \n\nWhy is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"In today’s world, the use of smartphones is very common, particularly among the young generation. Spending many hours on mobile phones has become a daily routine for some children. In my view, this is concerning and can be deemed a negative development due to the lack of creativity and potential hindrance in brain development. This essay will explore the reasons behind this case.\n\nNowadays, smartphones play an important role in people's lives. They serve not only as tools of communication but also as channels for online exploration. The perspectives on using phones freely vary depending on families and situations. Some parents might give permission to their kids for study purposes only because they could use the internet to find unlimited knowledge regardless of going to school. Others may allow phone usage for entertainment, such as watching cartoons on Youtube, as they believe it helps with relaxation.\n\nFrom my perspective, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks associated with uncontrolled phone usage. One significant issue is that when children spend more time on phones than going out to play with friends, they may lose social skills, which can lead to problems in their adulthood. Another adverse effect is that excessive phone use might cause health problems. Numerous studies suggest that prolonged screen time can directly impact concentration and memorization, especially in the younger generation who are increasingly reliant on smartphones.\n\nIn conclusion, excessive focus on screens every day can lead to adverse consequences for children. As a result, using smartphones for specific purposes should be allowed and monitored by parents to ensure their kids spend time online in an appropriate way.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va mo rong y tuong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some infomation is too important or too valueable to be shared freely.\"\nEssay:\n\"There are different opinions on whether to share free information related to scientific research, business and the academic world or consider such information too crucial for sharing. This essay will elaborate on both sides of this debate before explaining why I believe that not all information should be accessible to everyone.\n\nOn the one hand, some people believe that information should be available to the masses. Sharing research results can improve the speed of innovations. For example, having discovered a new method of some disease treatment, scientists may involve funds for further investigations. Furthermore, spreading valuable information ought to broaden one’s horizons. The availability of information causes people’s awareness and increases their knowledge. Take for example public libraries, where people can gain access to a lot of information.\n\nOn the other hand, individuals think that some data can lead to harmful repercussions for society. Spreading the information potentially may result in using it with bad intentions. Moreover, research findings in areas such as physics or chemistry could be used to create weapons that can threaten people’s well-being or lives. Also, distributing specific information may violate the intellectual property of people or companies and can even lead to responsibility before the law. For example, a company can lose a considerable amount of money because of a leak of commercial information.\n\nIn conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I think that some information can be profitable and helpful for people. However, it also can be dangerous.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays many people travel to foreign countries for pleasure. Some believe this travel has a negative impact on the countries travelled to.To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, there is an increasing number of tourists who visit foreign countries to get  relaxation. However, it is argued that travelling has negative influences on that particular area. I completely agree with this point of view because it may lead to crime and pollution of that destination.\n\nThe large number of tourists may cause a crime. It is undeniable that travellers bring  benefits to some particular countries. Since sightseers spend a considerable amount of money at the time of travelling, it could lead to an increase in the local businesses` income. But despite this fact, due to the throng of visitors in the bustling areas, there is a high chance for pickpockets to steal tourists` belongings elusively. This should be controlled with the help of the military or artificial intelligence otherwise their businesses will break down soon.\n\nIn addition, such a large volume of trippers can cause environmental problems to fragile habitats and historical sites. As holidaymakers may generate a massive amount of rubbish during the trip, disposal of this produced waste can be a challenging task for locals. Moreover, the mismanagement of litter can have a negative impact on the biosphere of that state. To illustrate,  Thailand has failed to mitigate water pollution and protect the natural environment due to the soaring amount of plastic rubbish left after the visit of tourists. \n\nIn conclusion, as far as I am concerned, I totally agree that travellers from overseas are causing  damage to the destination travelled to. For one thing, an increasing number of visitors can create a crime, for another the environment may be altered and polluted by human beings.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach the hien quan diem rang du lich co tac dong tieu cuc den cac quoc gia duoc du lich.\n- Y tuong duoc mo rong day du va ban da cung cap cac vi du cu the de minh hoa su anh huong tieu cuc cua du lich, bao gom tang toi pham va o nhiem moi truong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Education should be free to all people and\n\nshould be paid for and managed by the\n\ngovernment Do you agree or disagree with this\n\nstatement..\"\nEssay:\n\"It is undeniable that education plays an important role in people's lives , so according to some, education ought to be free of cost for society and some money should be allotted by the government to education and its management should be done by the state. In my opinion, offering everyone free education by the government would be problematic due to the heavy pressure on the government's shoulders and its bad effects on the efforts of students.\n\nOne of the reasons is that abolishing educational fees at all levels would put a tremendous burden on the suffering economy of most  countries around the world, especially developing countries. This means that developing countries have been struggling with fundamental issues, which are more crucial than literacy, and thus allocating some heavy financial aid to educational facilities would reduce the money for tackling  more essential problems including poverty, unemployment and the high rate of infectious diseases. For example, providing free education for people who are suffering from dangerous illnesses in underprivileged regions would not be advantageous for them.\n\nAnother important factor to consider is that eliminating educational fees in all grades might decrease the motivation of students. In other words, because of providing free of cost education regardless of students' scores, students would not be incentivised to work hard for better scores or take their studies seriously. Since free elementary, secondary and higher education are guaranteed for all pupils by the state, they are not motivated to put their whole heart into learning their lessons and be the best student for getting scholarships. For instance, the majority of young adults are trying to study hard and get full marks in university exams to be funded by famous British universities.\n\nIn conclusion, managing and providing educational materials and facilities freely would be problematic due to its financial aspects for most regions and decreasing level of motivation among students.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nOverall, bai viet cua ban dap ung phan lon yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In spite of the advances made in agriculture, many people around the world still go hungry.\n\nWhy is this the case?\n\nWhat can be done about this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"It has been argued that many social members from all over the planet still do not have enough food despite the developments that have been made in agriculture. This phenomenon occurred because of the unpredicted rise in world population, however, there are steps that can be taken to overcome this issue and the most effective one is making a trust-worthy prognostication by means of AI and data science.\n\nNowadays, it is easier to raise kids compared to the old times. In addition, there are many places that are designed to take care of children or educate them when they are seven or older. That is the reason why couples find having two or three kids, worry-free and less risky. They can rely on these organizations for further assistance and bring up new family members and also work at the same time. In this way, having better circumstances to raise children has led to population growth.\n\nPresently, we are facing a boom in technology evolution and the best example of this is Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, there are servers which are capable of processing huge amounts of data and producing accurate results. So, by using the help of these modern options, we can train the population model on previous years' data and also predict its probable growth due to various factors, in the near future. Finally, having a point of view on how things will change can help us make better plans.\n\nTo sum up, the problem of hunger in spite of the growth in agriculture is caused by making a false assumption and it is likely to be solved by using the maximum accuracy when we decide to make future plans.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai vi da de cap den van de canh bao rang hien nay van con nhieu nguoi tren the gioi khong co du thuc pham, mac du co su tien bo trong nong nghiep.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"as well as making money businesses also have aresponsibility towards society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed that rather than focusing only on gaining profit, organisations should contribute and should adhere to corporate responsibility towards the community. I completely agree with the aforementioned notion and the reasons will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, there are a plethora of causes for the agreement with the above-asserted statement. In the modern era, big companies generally focus only on piling up money. However, they do not provide quality in return to the individuals. To be more precise, these corporations gain success only because of the public and once they get successful they forget to provide good quality  and authentic products in a race to earn heaps of money. Therefore, they should be involved in socio-economic activities. It is also essential for them to earn profit in order to run their business in an adequate manner.\n\nProbing further, as these companies earn a large amount of money, they can help to eradicate poverty from society. In other words, these huge companies can provide employment to individuals and should help them financially by giving an appropriate amount of salary according to their work. While a company is financially stable, it should be indulged in charitable social activities .For instance, during the corona pandemic, tata company supported their employees by providing them with adequate amounts for their survival in that challenging situation. \n\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although it is necessary for a company to earn money to manage their livelihood, they should provide people with desired quality  according to the price and help the community through donation practices.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach chi tiet va day du.

It sparked a debate regarding its necessity and effectiveness . I firmly disagree with this notion. My viewpoints along with some reasons will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, enforcing a curfew on youngsters restrict their personal freedom and curtails their ability to broaden their horizon. They should be given the freedom to discover their interests and independence. For example,  a teenager with a passion for music may be a part of the band and they mostly perform at  night. Thus, imposing a curfew can limit their approaches and  prevent them from sharing their talent in the community.\n\nProbing further, curfew often fails to address the root cause of juvenile delinquency.It is not certain that most of the crimes  are contrived at  night, they are even performed in the daytime. So, restricting the movement of teenagers is not the solution , it would rather make them more aggressive by not letting them  enjoy their teenage lives. Therefore, it will force them to do illegal activities and break the law to do  things in their interest.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that although the  laws and norms are applied for the betterment of citizens, the root causes and the consequences should be kept in mind . Hence, it is not a law which should be  enforced on youngsters\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTai sao toi hinh dung no duoc dua ra mot cach chi tiet hon doi voi Task Response (Su dap ung nhiem vu):\n- Cau tra loi cau hoi de bai: bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach bay to y kien rang ban khong dong y voi viec ap dat gioi nghiem gio giac doi voi cac thanh thieu nien.\n- Da dang cac y tuong: bai viet cua ban da di vao chi tiet cac y kien ca nhan cua ban va cac lap luan de ho tro y kien.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"People should look after their health as a duty to the society where they live, rather than for their own benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is true that some people think we should be responsible for taking care of our own health as a duty to society, whereas others consider that maintaining our fitness is just for our own good. Personally, I believe that both criteria should be given equal consideration. \n\nOn the one hand, if we underestimate the importance of having good health, it might create a burden on the community. To be more specific, having an unhealthy body might lead to a variety of diseases, and people need to go to the hospital for treatment which sometimes occupies a lot of social resources, especially in countries that provide great social welfare. People might need to pay more tax due to the problems mentioned above. \n\nOn the other hand, we can get several benefits by maintaining a healthy body. First of all, people who have good health do not need medication and they could save a lot of money. Secondly, with a healthy body, people could be more productive at work which is definitely an essential factor in one’s career. Last but not least, when we talk about well-being, it is not only physical but also mental. Lots of research has shown the importance of our mental health. People with great mental health could live a longer and more positive life. \n\nIn conclusion, while taking good care of one’s health could regard as a duty to the society where we live, it could also help people to improve their life quality. So it’s a win-win situation to maintain a healthy body for all of us.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la danh gia chi tiet ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\nVe Task Response:\n- Bai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va kham pha ca hai quan diem duoc neu ra (\"people should look after their health as a duty to society\" va \"maintaining fitness is just for their own good\").\n- Ban da trinh bay y kien ca nhan cua minh ro rang o dong thu hai cua bai viet (\"Personally, I believe that both criteria should be given equal consideration\").\n\nTuy nhien, co mot so diem can duoc cai thien:\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"The private car has greatly improved individual freedom of movement and has become a status symbol for many people. Yet the use of private cars has contributed to some of today's most serious problems.\n\nHow can the use of private cars be reduced?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays owning a car provides you with a lot more freedom due to the fact that you can travel anywhere without experiencing the excessive extra stops public transport offers. some people also view it as a status symbol, especially when you own a German one as they are very exclusive and really expensive. Nevertheless, private automobiles have been the cause of many environmental issues globally, and so, this essay will discuss a couple of solutions that could be implemented to reverse this problem. \n\nDaily usage of millions of cars brings about environmental issues such as air pollution contributing to breathing problems. Additionally, it also eventually thins out the ozone layer allowing harmful UV rays to enter the atmosphere causing skin cancer. To combat this, firstly, tax zone areas should be implemented in places that have a lot of congestion such as city centres, for instance. The more the public is taxed the less they are inclined to use their cars. \n\nweight gain is also a problem that comes about from the excessive use of cars. Many citizens that drive everywhere put on weight quicker, America, for example, is one of the nations that have the most morbidly obese residents worldwide. Therefore, I believe if more cities have pedestrian zones, the public would exercise passively as more local attractions would be easily accessible. Thirdly, carbon-free travel, such as trams which run on electricity, contribute to no pollution, will be an excellent addition to public transportation. \n\nIn conclusion, governmental authorities should implement a couple of these easy fixes right away as they would greatly impact the global environment and even people's health positively.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da neu ra mot so giai phap cu the de giam viec su dung xe ca nhan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the future, nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\"\nEssay:\n\"The appearance of internet service is a topical issue in the present world. The majority of people argue that  the existence of online viewers allows free them to read everything instead of purchasing paper-based media. I partly support this opinion.\n\nIndubitably, there are several measures why printed media is continuously popular among dwellers in the future. Foremost, interpreters can interpret attractive articles by journals which concentrate to announce dominant issues in their countries. Moreover, lots of companies in relation to the news have experts on checking the information and correcting proper words. As a result, subscribers easily allow main issues without fake and wrong delivery. Apart from that, online reading needs to connect with the network to access the internet to read.\n\nOn the flip side, applying online services is beneficial to users and it will be the dominant media a few years later. Firstly, residents do not need to bring heavy items whenever they go outside. To be precise, they bring smart devices which are light and it requires the only a network to enter  online. For instance, they can bring more stuff when they go to cafes and other places since they have more space to keep their items. Besides, the internet gives us the possibility to download our ancestor's writing because most of them have already been copied by libraries which is hard to find original books.\n\nIn a nutshell, although it demonstrates numerous reasons why some people still advocate paper media, I am personally of the view that digital media will be dominant in the future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang viec the hien quan diem cua minh ve viec in an giay va sach se khong con nhieu nguoi mua trong tuong lai vi moi nguoi co the doc tat ca moi thu ma ho muon truc tuyen ma khong can phai tra tien.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries, people live with their parents and siblings until their old age. Do you think there are more advantages or disadvantages to this behaviour? \n\nDiscuss your opinion and provide specific reasons and\n\nexamples to support your answer.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays the world has changed tremendously from the past ,but some people remain with their traditions. In certain cities, one has the option to stay with their legal guardians, brothers and sister for  years. I think that anyone can live with their parents until they reach a certain age that they should move out of their house. \n\n     On the one hand, there are multiple advantages for someone to live at their parent's home. First, living at their parent's house with children ,especially grandchildren often makes them happy. Moreover, when living away from their parents' house  makes them feel sad because they might feel they will not see you again. Second, grandparents teach their grandchildren  past traditions. For example, some elderly in the middle east teach their kids how  life was in the past and how they adapted to it. Finally, this may also help the parents if they are ill. Nevertheless, when others learn that this country's civilians live with their parents for this reason this will boost their reputation.  \n\n   However, on the other hand, there are disadvantages to this case. Firstly, living with siblings may result in conflicts happening between them. In some ,countries statistics have shown that the number one factor to divorce is family issues. lastly, living with parents will not let individuals depend on themselves. Not only will this ruin the idea of people not being dependable but also not having the responsibility to do a task. If a person is not responsible it would make him not trusted within his community. \n\n   In conclusion, there are several advantages to individuals living with their parents, however, there are also disadvantages to it.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi de bai bang viec thao luan ca loi ich va han che cua viec song cung gia dinh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"It is often considered that change is more beneficial to people than trying to avoid it and have everything remain the same. Do you think the advantages of change outweigh the disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many people believe that transition adds enormous value to their lives, but others refuse to change and prefer to stay the same. Although change may be unsettling for some, I consider the benefits of personal growth that generated by change exceed any disadvantages.\n\nOn the one hand, People resist change because their minds are used to certain circumstances. This means that people grow up with certain experiences and cultures. As a result, they form certain behaviours and beliefs. This makes it difficult for people to embrace change since it causes discomfort or undesired tension. For example, it is extremely difficult for an obese person to involve any change in their lifestyle. Moreover, even slight adjustments cause them give up and anxiety. However, I believe that a stronger support system can assist individuals to get over this issue and embrace the benefits of change.\n\nOn the other hand, The advantage of change is that it brings growth into life. Either can be personal growth or professional growth. It makes people happy when they see them improving in certain aspects of life. People push their discomfort to see new boundaries, which allows them to see life differently. As an illustration, I used to start an occupation that I had never done before. I was hesitant in the early stages, but eventually, I slowly adapted and accepted the role change. As a result, it brings to tremendous growth on a personal and professional level. Therefore, it is possible to draw a direct correlation between change and happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, people refuse growth because of the fear or anxiety they experience, but I once again restate that the benefits of embracing change outweigh the risks when we see how it adds to our happiness and fulfillment.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach thao luan ca hai quan diem khac nhau ve su thay doi va rut ra ket luan rang loi ich cua su thay doi vuot troi hon bat ky bat loi nao.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Everyone should stay at school until 18. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is said that all students should stay at school until the age of eighteen. Although staying at school until adulthood can bring  enormous benefits, I still disagree with this idea for many reasons, which will be outlined in this essay.\n\n   To begin with, children should continue to study at school until the age of eighteen does have several certain advantages. Firstly, there is a major group of young people, who is less than eighteen years old, have very little practical experience and have very little intention of what goals they will direct. Consequently, staying at school until mature age will help them have a suitable environment to develop their education and time to think about their future career path. Moreover, compelling candidates to stay at the institute until eighteen will create a better-educated future generation of people, which may assist to reduce social problems and unemployment rates.\n\n    However, there is the figure of drawbacks that makes me disagree with this idea. It can be seen that many children these days do not fit in with the common education system and forcing them to remain at school can cause some problems. For example, these kinds of students are usually very disruptive in a classroom and this affects other students who are striving for study. Additionally, most students many children choose to follow careers that do not require them to continue studying in school past the age of sixteen. For instance, for those who wish to follow a career that requires more practical-based learning, such as a qualified builder, electrician, or machinery operator, it is quite unnecessary to remain at school until the age of eighteen.\n\n    In conclusion, although there are many beneficial advantages for children remaining at school until adulthood. In my view, I personally feel that the drawbacks outweigh the positives mentioned above.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDiem manh la ban da co mot quan diem rieng ve viec hoc sinh nen o lai truong den khi 18 tuoi va da trinh bay lap luan de ho tro quan diem do.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that children’s leisure activities must be educational, otherwise they are a complete waste of time. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your experience.\"\nEssay:\n\"The question of whether children’s leisure activities must be educational has sparked heated debate. Some regard that all events should have their aim or purpose, while others see entertaining events as also beneficial. I personally contend with the idea that leisure activities for kids are not necessarily educational, and other events are also meaningful. In this essay, I will elaborate reasons in more detail and provide my personal experience.\n\nFirst of all, educational events with certain purposes usually bring pressure and can be easily observed. When parents and educators intentionally required students to participate in some particular activities, they become unwilling to cooperate and tend to lose their motivation and curiosity on certain topics. Since, it is their nature that people hate to be forced to do something and so are youngsters, thus, planned events with some goals consistently backfired and ultimately killed the possibility for them.\n\nOn the other hand, facts are proven that non-educational events can also result in educational values. Playing basketball, for instance, is seen as a mere recreational sport. However, it is well-known that individuals who joined basketball teams have performed better leadership, negotiation skills and teamwork ability. This is because when a team is playing to win, it grows related skills mentioned that equipped themselves, and makes them capable of winning. Therefore, we can end up learning from those events who regards as only complete waste of time.\n\nRegarding my personal experiences, while often seen as a recreational activity, watching America TV shows (such as Friends) has brought unthinkable positive effects on me. Indulging in beloved dramas, my English improved to the next level since I was more familiar with its pronunciation and sentence structure. Surprisingly, it was events without a purpose that benefited me.\n\nIn conclusion, educational events do not always reach their original goals, and possibly cased opposite outcomes. Additionally, entertainment can otherwise provide valuable educational achievements. Therefore, activities for teens should not be detailly planned, and certainly shall not always be educational.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai bang cach the hien quan diem cua minh ve viec lieu cac hoat dong giai tri cua tre em co can phai mang tinh giao duc hay khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Governments should spend money on railways rather than roads.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\"\nEssay:\n\"There have been many controversial arguments surrounding investing in railways or roads for the better. But instead of choosing one, I decide to choose both. In fact, if the government decides to allocate both, we will have lots of advantages for the entire nation.\n\nFor starters, railways are a meaningful invention that the ancients made. On average, the volume that trains can carry up to 300 tons of category, is beneficial to everyone. Railways capacity is more significant. Despite transporting people and goods as a huge mass, it still saves energy when running compared to other vehicles reducing environmental pollution. Regarding speed, rail lines facilitate faster transporting/ transportation. In the modern century, commerce sites connecting every means of transport are very popular therefore when people place an order, they tend to want it delivered today. The train line is a good choice for freight. Besides, since the train uses separate lanes, the problems to do with a high volume of traffic will be rectified and avoid unexpected crashes. According to lots of citizens’ perspectives, it’s safer and cheaper when we use railways. \n\nNext is roadways that have many advantages nothing less than railways. For starters, people are used to using roads, so investment in roads should be paid more attention. Streets are maintained periodically because it often has many potholes and slippery roads that are not repaired, making riders extremely nervous. Regarding the good level of happiness of the citizens, they feel contented with high-quality streets which offer them the convenience in commuting travelling time. At the same time, roadways also have flexibility. When the road is stuck, you can choose to take another route, and the locals or the map will guide you. Nowadays, if you have a problem with means of transportation, you can use the app to book the car therefore it is very convenient.\n\nIn general, spending money on both can be difficult for the national budget so there should be cooperation from private, public and environmental organizations to invest costs and reduce environmental pollution. Along with that, it is necessary for people’s awareness to speak up and discuss the issues that people want to solve from there the government will focus on solving urgent problems\n\nIn conclusion, investment in railways and roadways is a good option to provide a better transport experience for people and benefit the whole society in terms of environmental protection and safety on the road.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da de cap den ca tuyen duong sat va tuyen duong bo, do do, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In some countries elder people are to work longer and not to retire. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working beyond retirement age.\"\nEssay:\n\"As more and more nations age, more and more elderly are encouraged to continue working over retirement age. In my opinion, there are possible benefits and drawbacks of extending individual working life.\n\nOn the positive side, working beyond retirement age can be beneficial in the following aspects. Firstly, continuing work improves the elderly's financial condition. More years in the job mean more experience, which in turn means more revenue. For skilled jobs, such as doctors, engineers and professors, people approaching retirement age tend to have rich experience and are also in the highest income period of their career. Furthermore, an elder person may find that having a job provides a sense of satisfaction. This is because people who have jobs have a sense of identity and feel they are part of society, which is necessary to maintain a good mental state. Not only that, but the active movement a job provides could help keep one’s body healthy. As physical exercise is important for everyone, especially for the elderly.\n\nHowever, there are possible influences if people work after the average expected years. Obviously, it could damage their health condition. The older a human is, the more rest they need. When the elders do not get enough time to recover, it will pose a huge burden on  their bodies, leading to a series of physical problems, even death. Another disadvantage is that the interpersonal relationship can be affected. After investing so many years of one’s life into a career, they deserve a life of leisure and family happiness. If they are still occupied with a job, there will be less time to do what they love to do and enjoy with their family. In that case, some of them may develop a lonely lifestyle. \n\nIn conclusion, there are benefits and risks to motivating old people to continue their careers. It could maintain health and acquire a sense of fulfilment, meanwhile, it could also result in more exhaustion and solitude. For those who continue to work beyond retirement age, it may be helpful to replace manual work with mental work as much as possible.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai ve loi va hai cua lam viec sau tuoi nghi huu.

In this essay, I will discuss both points of view to clarify my own opinion.\n\nTo begin with, it is certain that music has been considered a way of expression but also a way of entertainment in different cultures over the centuries. For instance, every time there is a celebration, music is played, as well as people in their own houses like to listen to the radio because they feel better. However, music is much more than that. People who reduce the music only to a way to get distracted and get fun is having a very limited view of it. \n\nOn the other hand, considering music only as an entertainment pattern would be offensive to this magnificent humankind's creation.  For instance, there are records that music exists since humankind commenced to make their firsts technological developments, in which it has been demonstrated to be a way of expression, contributing to communication with others and the organisation of rituals. In other words, neither centuries ago nor in the present, music has been created to express and communicate emotions, ideas and a sense of energy, which also had an enormous impact on the audience because of its magnificence. This is why people may confuse the purpose of music with mere entertainment, as music has always been loved by humankind.\n\nIn conclusion, music is an artistic expression that allows multiple interpretations, which also explains why some people could think that is only to get entertained, as music does not say how need to be interpreted or even understood. Although, we cannot deny that music is greater than that and we need to put it in the right place that truly deserves inside the society. Music is critical for our lives.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach ban luan ca hai quan diem (am nhac la mot phuong tien giai tri va am nhac dong vai tro quan trong trong xa hoi) va dua ra quan diem ca nhan cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Universities should provide students with the skills they will require in order to succeed at their future jobs.\n\nTo what extrnt do you agree or disagree with the above opinion? \n\nWhat are the some of the job skills employers look for new employees.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is commonly argued that universities should provide students with the skills they will require in order to succeed at their future jobs. Personally, I completely agree with this opinion for a variety of reasons and suggest some types of skills that are suitable for new employees,\n\nFirst of all, in my opinion, I agree that the main mission of each university is perfecting the human inside of each student with tools which are social skills . Because of that, every university has to graduate with the type of skills or abilities that are making a difference with others so that students have a higher chance to succeed in their choices. So to make this idea more effective, I think that all education systems should eliminate courses that are not necessary for work. For example, politics is a subject that would bring nearly non-profitable value to any kind of student. Because each  student is experienced with that kind of morality course for about 10 years before going to university.\n\nThere is a variety of skills that are needed by new employees. Firstly, it is communication skills which is the way we speak, and talk with co-workers, and how we persuade people in marketing is an aspect that nearly everybody forgets about it. The tone, speed, pitch of voice and speech is a combination that brings many values to us and it is kinda easy to achieve that. Secondly, time management skill is an ability that always needs in the working environment and normal life. It doesn't just give us confidence, high performance in finishing tasks. Furthermore, it creates a good attitude with the people working with you so you can make many relationships.\n\nIn conclusion,Universities should bring out the skills that are needed for the community and teach that for students and communication is a great example of a skill that is suitable and helpful for working.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nDuoi day la mot phan tich chi tiet hon ve Task Response trong bai viet cua ban:\n\n1.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.’\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, modern society  believes that children should play outdoor games and spend time with family after getting home. Others argue finishing homework is more important. I will elaborate on these points and give my opinion in forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with the importance of homework, it plays an important role in a pupil's life. If they would be given homework they can easily recall and memorise what they studied at school and also parents can track their progress by helping children finish it. For instance, if a certain chapter is read at school and juveniles are given questions to answer from that le lesson, they can revise it and  parents will also get involved in this and progeny will automatically become more serious towards their academic performance.\n\nOn the flip side of the coin, there are other measures which should be taken care of for the well-being of offspring. Family and teachers should encourage them to take part in other physical activities and extra curriculums. Because if one is not physically fit he or she cannot become mentally strong. For example, We should leave studying at school because that is why we pay fees. At home, we should spend time with kids and give them time to relax. \n\nTo conclude, we should not stress our youngsters about education every time. We should teach them other aspects of life like integrity and kindness. Schools are there to take care of their academics.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, nhiem vu duoc thuc hien mot cach tong quat, nhung no chua dat den muc do phan tich va mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.\"\nEssay:\n\"A group of individuals present the view that reaching to enhanced economic situation is the key factor in a society and it will be a decisive factor in papulation's happiness, whereas others believe the improvement in other approaches is as vital as economic one. I strongly agree with the latter opinion since the importance of other human needs should be considered besides money.\n\nOn one hand, some people justifiably believe that prosperity in every field should be allocated by the governments. As these improvements offer a wealth of welfare such as security, accommodations, freedom and etc. From a medical standpoint, it is highly important to be healthy. Therefore, the reinforcement in the healthcare system is equally important as earning more money. Owing to better health circumstances, it is required a great education system as well. Consequently, the education system should nurture adept doctors and nurses. For instance, some African countries have been improving the basic amenities like better medical situation which has resulted in less suffering from a disease.\n\nOn the other hand, another group of papulation argue that earning a great deal of money is the most impressive trait of society. They insist that this action accelerates the process of achieving dreams and aims. However, I do not find this debate convincing as wealth no longer plays a crucial role in personal satisfaction. Despite the importance of property, people should be safe and healthy to utilize that earnings so as to their purposes. Moreover, prosperity in every other approach not only provides a higher standard of living but also boosts the greatness fleeing in a country. As a result, these other successes will be available, if the governments give a head to future improvement and not isolated to economy. \n\nTo conclude, in my view, although money is an integral part of life, other progresses solidify people’s satisfaction as well such as reinforcing the health care system.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

I believe the statements that state any electronic media has bad effects on the community.\n\nOn the one hand, it cannot be denied that technology has helped people to fill their spare time, so watching television and playing some video games can reduce individuals' stress which has gathered. For example, some elders who have retired and no longer have activities, commonly, they fill their free time by consuming attractive dramas or movies which can entertain in order to keep fit and their mental health. In addition, playing some video games on gadgets for children this activity it is not only as entertainment but also can enhance their skills to solve problems that appear in video games. Therefore, problems solving skills will be very useful for provision when they are growing up.\n\nOn the other hand, Many channels are not responsible for their shows since they are only considering the movies that have been provided to gather as many viewers and the providers do not give quality shows in which quality shows can educate people, and the impact will make people to be more clever. Furthermore, despite the benefits of playing video games, there are many disadvantages if we allow kids to enjoy playing games excessively.

Thus, essential tasks will be abandoned by the kids, such as homework, studying, and playing with peers.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many advantages and disadvantages by doing activities like watching television and playing games.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"In the future nobody will buy printed newspapers or books because they will be able to read everything they want online without paying to what extents do you agree or disagree with this statement.\"\nEssay:\n\"it is commonly argued that nobody will buy a printed newspaper or book because they will be able to read everything they want to apply online. I 'm strongly agreed with this opinion\n\nFirst of all,  the Internet was a path leading to a new era that nearly everybody is knowing to apply. This is because the growth and expansion of the internet is pretty fast that can affect all over the world. From that, people have to change their usual life : chatting, streaming, making money on the internet and more. Reading newspapers or check is an activity that can be easily affected in this situation and have to make a change. For example, the number of newspapers or statement that are printed annually is decreased by a certain percentage every year. As a result, there is maybe no more printed data in the future.\n\nSecondly, the number of paper which is made from trees that are used to print newspapers or bill is enormous and highly cost. Because of that reason, the Internet is a great way to reduce those printed knowledge. From that saving, People can decline the money going out of their pocket and invest in online info which is way more effective to create profit. Also, there are various values that only can find on the internet. For example, you can control and analyse the number of units that are sold. With that highly valued information, you can find that the figure that you selling get interested by others.\n\nIn conclusion, printed check be destructive because the appearance of the internet and the value that it gives don't worth the effort. In my opinion, all kinds of printing info be disappeared soon for a good reason which is to recreate this social.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, y chinh cua ban la dong y voi tuyen bo rang khong ai se mua bao in hoac sach do moi thu deu co the doc truc tuyen ma khong can tra phi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some parents think that childcare centres provide the best services for children of pre-school age. Other working parents think that family members such as grandparents will provide better care for their kids.\n\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Most guidances opine that letting their lineage with childcare centres is an appropriate way of pre-school age, however, the other side mentions that they should let their grandparents take care of the children. I totally disagree with both opinions.\n\nOn one hand, working parents decide to choose childcare centres to take care of the lineage because they don’t have enough time to spend with their children and the preschool session is an important period for the offspring to learn primary skills such as walking, reading and speaking so this place can teach these lessons. For instance,understanding the growth process will increase the offspring’s capability, hence, the existence of a professional will help the parents while they aren’t available to discover by themself. \n\nOn the other hand, regardless of the growing process, the other side mentions that safety is very important. Despite the existence of professionals, however, they can’t identify everyone’s personality so they opine that family members such as grandparents will serve as another alternative solution. For example, the grandparents are the ones who know their personality so they can genuinely trust them to take better care of the offspring.  \n\nIn conclusion, instead of a variety of solutions, I think that the parents should look after themself because this period is the time that they will see their own son develop and learn. Although they have to work many days. Childcare centres can’t guarantee that the growth procession will go in a fantastic way so they should discover and look after themself.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some think that a country’s success is completely dependent on economic progress while others believe that other factors are also important. \n\nWhat are the different factors contributing to the success of a country? \n\nDo you believe that one factor is more important than others?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is argued by some individuals that economic progress is one of the main contributing factors to the country’s success. Although economic progress is one of the criteria for the nation’s success, I believe the social progress index should also be considered. \n\nOn the one hand, the growth of the economy is the main criterion that makes a country become great. The measurement of economic progress is GDP (growth domestic product) or the amount a country earns. America is one   example of a country which has high GDP index based on the world bank, and this nation also considers a top five successful country due to being one of the highest-income nations in the world. In addition, an unemployment rate includes a progressive economic rate in a country. When people have a job, they can afford their basic needs such as meals, accommodation, and bills. The less of the unemployment rate is, the more successful a nation is. The UK is one of the countries that has the lowest unemployment rate so  this country is one of the successful countries based on economic growth criteria.\n\nOn the other hand, social index progress is an important factor that should be considered to assess a country’s success. The social index progress includes how the countries serve their populations, human rights, access to education and health, and a fair law system. For instance, Denmark and New Zealand are two countries that consider to be successful countries based on  social criteria. Both countries treat their citizens really well. Populations in Denmark feel happy because of the measurement of social index progress; the employees feel satisfied with their work because their rights are fulfilled whether right as an employee or as a citizen in Denmark. It is also known that the index of worker turnover in Denmark is low. Although the GDP rate in Denmark is far less than in America and the UK, the index of happiness in this country is the highest among other countries around the world. This means social index progress is the far pivotal criterion to make a country great.           \n\nTo sum up, while economic factors are the criteria that make successful countries, I believe that based on the citizen perspective social factors are more significant in terms of a progressive country.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi trong de bai bang cach xac dinh cac yeu to dong gop vao su thanh cong cua mot quoc gia va cho biet quan diem cua ban ve su quan trong cua nhung yeu to nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Success is often measured by wealth and material belongings. Do you think wealth is the best measure of success? What makes a successful person?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is no doubt that the measuring scale for the success  of a person   is wealth and materialistic things. I am disagreed that money is the only success factor in human life.Factors of success vary from person to person which I would discuss further in this essay.\n\n   Firstly,wealth can not demonstrate  how successful a person is,it depends on the  goals and achievements of a person.For instance,if there is a doctor it does not matter how much money he has or which cars he is driving which things matter in his medical skills and how many lives he has saved besides this for athletes money is not a success because money can not make him good athlete there are other abilities such as consistency, discipline, hard work,dedication and talent , rather than money for athlete only achievement is how many medals and trophies he had won.So,money and other luxuries do not make a person successful.\n\n    Secondly,wealth makes a person look successful towards others but for the rich money is nothing.For example,there are a lot of people who have money to purchase food but can not eat desired food due to different diseases besides this many millionaires and even billionaires ended their lives due to various painful and awful diseases if money is successful then why is money can not by them good health? because money can only purchase materials besides this wealth and material all these things are left behind when a person dies ,so rather than preferring wealthy life  people should prefer happy life.\n\n To conclude, it is clear that money is not a scale to measure the success of others because they may not see money as success whereas the success  scale varies   from person to person.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va y tuong cua ban da duoc mo rong day du.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Traffic and accomodation problems are increasing and government should encourage some businesses to move from cities to rural areas. Do the advantages outweigh the\n\n disadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"The increasing number of vehicles and housing problems have caused officials to motivate businesses to relocate from major cities to the countryside. Whilst acknowledging that there are drawbacks, this essay will argue that the advantages of this change will outweigh the disadvantages.\n\nTo begin with, the predominant advantage of the moving away of companies is definitely the development of the countryside. To further explain this, the relocation of major companies to the countryside is going to increase the labour force which would in turn help in economic growth leading to more education and employment opportunities, hence causing the rural areas to develop. Another major advantage of the relocation of businesses would be reduced pollution levels in major cities. With the reverse migration to rural areas, there would be a reduced number of automobiles leading to less carbon footprint and decreasing greenhouse effect. For instance, The major city in India, Delhi, is ranked as the most polluted city in the country, because of  overpopulation and huge traffic problems. Thus, the economic and environmental aspect of the relocation of businesses is highly advantageous.\n\nWhile the aforementioned pros, there are several negative aspects to this that still need to be considered. One of the biggest drawbacks is the cost and time it would require to travel to work. People who live in the centre would now have to change their lifestyle and commute almost 30 to 40 kilometres every day to the job which would require not only plenty of time but also would cost a lot of money too, leading to elevated stress levels. For example, a research study done by  Harvard University showed that stress levels were more in an individual whose work was far away from home as compared to the one who loved nearby his job. \n\nTo conclude, Although there are numerous benefits and drawbacks of moving businesses to the rural side at the same time,  the economic and  environmental benefits of the relocation of businesses are tremendous. Hence, the positive effects of  moving companies away definitely outweigh the negative ones.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi trong de bai.

I completely disagree with this idea and would like to explain it from my perspective.\n\nTo begin with, the education system in many countries is prepared to answer all necessities, such as mathematics, and gardening. During the non-academic lesson time, young people have a chance to be interested in different areas which they like doing. This feeling helps to work in non-pressure situations. As a result of this situation, young people could focus on easily next academic session.\n\nOn the other hand, most young people don't have any idea what to do in their future life as a business. This opportunity gives them to understand which activity fits their persona and character. According to some scientific reports, being keen on non-academic subjects is one of the best ways of relaxation at school. because of this situation, teenagers are encouraged to learn something besides academic subjects by their teachers and families. Thus, youngster and their families could learn about children's abilities and strong ways in their personal life.\n\nAll things to be considered, the education system should include both academic and non-academic subjects to prepare children for real life.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Traffic and accomodation problems are increasing and government should encourage some businesses to move from cities to rural areas. Do the advantages outweigh the \n\ndisadvantages?\"\nEssay:\n\"The increasing number of vehicles and housing problems have caused officials to motivate businesses to relocate from major cities to the countryside. This essay will demonstrate how this relocation is beneficial in the economic growth of fewer populace areas but also might cause problems by making commuting longer for workers. Although relocating businesses can possess some undesirable drawbacks, I think that the merits still outweigh its counterpart. \n\nTo begin with, the predominant advantage of the moving away of companies is definitely the development of the countryside. In view of this, the relocation of major companies to the countryside is going to increase the labour force which would in turn help in economic growth leading to more education and employment opportunities, consequently causing the rural areas to develop. Another major advantage of relocating businesses would be reduced pollution levels in major cities. With the reverse migration to rural areas, there would be a reduced number of automobiles leading to less carbon footprint and decreasing greenhouse effect. For instance, A major city in India, Delhi, is ranked as the most polluted city in the country, if the number of vehicles was to reduce, it would decrease the amount of CO2 emissions causing less air pollution. As a result, it would lead to a safer environment for citizens.\n\nWhile the aforementioned pros, there are several negative aspects to this that still need to be considered. One of the biggest drawbacks is the cost and time it would require to travel to work. People who live in the centre would now have to change their lifestyle and commute almost 30 to 40 kilometres every day to the job which would require not only plenty of time but also would cost a lot of money too, leading to elevated stress levels. To exemplify, a research study done by  Harvard University showed that stress levels were more in an individual whose work was far away from home as compared to the one who lived nearby his job. Thus, the increased travel time to work would result into decreasing the quality of life.\n\nTo conclude, Although there are numerous benefits and drawbacks of moving businesses to the rural side at the same time,  the economic and  environmental benefits of the relocation of businesses are tremendous. Hence, the positive effects of  moving companies away definitely outweigh the negative ones.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da dua ra y tuong de mo rong cau tra loi cua minh.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that children should be allowed to stay at home and play until they are six or seven years old. Others believe that it is important for young children to go to school as soon as possible.\n\nWhat do you think are the advantages of attending school from a young age?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the modern era, there is a huge debate about most  people thinking that children should stay home and enjoy their lives until they are seven years old. However, others think that children should join  school at an early stage. A large group of people think in its favour. While others have the opposite opinion. The following paragraphs shed light on my personal opinion with a suitable example. \n\nI agree with the statement that children should not go to school at an early age. There are numerous reasons why I am in favour of it. The most important reason is that children are not understand everything at an early age. Their mindset does not accept easily new changes. As a result, they start crying at the school. Another pivotal aspect is that when children go to school at the age of 3 or 4, their development and creativity levels disturb. In other words, they start to focus only on their school-related subjects. Moreover, parents should allow their children to stay at home do extra activities and play different types of helpful games, which enhance their creativity power. To justify my stay of mind, I would like to give an example of a survey, which was conducted by Sydney University. The survey relieved the finding that in many developed countries there is a rule, they cannot start schooling before the age of 6 or 7  in the USA they start schooling at the age of six and in  Australia, they start at the age of seven.\n\nOn the contrary, many people oppose the above-mentioned statement for many reasons, individuals believe that if they start their children's schooling late then children waste their time at home. In addition, children's interests may be diverted to some other activities. \n\nTo recapitulate, according to the arguments aforementioned above. One can reach the conclusion that the benefits of  late schooling are indeed too great to ignore.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den nhung loi ich cua viec tham gia truong hoc tu khi con nho.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some species of animals are almost extinct; and many others seem to be fast approaching a similar risk. What are the reasons for this? What should be done to solve this problem.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, the issue of worldwide animal extinction has become a strongly debated topic. A wide range of species almost disappeared completely in the past few decades, while many others are close enough to do the same. This is due to the enormously increased human activity in their habitats. In my essay, I am going to reveal the reasons behind this, and I try to suggest some solutions as well.\n\nThe biggest reason behind disappearing most of these animals is hunting. For instance, in some Asian countries buying a tooth of a tiger on the black market is a very popular habit. This leads to the fact, that the illegal hunting of tigers is growing continuously. In addition, many other species are in danger related to global climate change. For example, the living area of polar bears is decreasing dramatically due to the melting of icebergs at the North Pole.\n\nAs long as the most likely reason for animal extinction is the human impact on their habitats, the solution must be also developed by us. According to hunting, the government should give a strong response, like a prison sentence for those, who hunt tigers illegally. Furthermore, reducing the emission of carbon dioxide can be effective to decrease global warming. This might result in the growth of the living area of polar bears again.\n\nIn conclusion, human impact on wildlife has caused the extinction of some species. Both overhunting and global warming have serious effects on wildlife diversity. I strongly hope that mankind can solve these issues as soon as possible before it turns too late.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nVe viec tra loi dung cau hoi de bai, bai viet cua ban da dat duoc dieu nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some countries have become much richer than others. Richer countries should now help poorer countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"Numerous nations are becoming more affluent these days, whereas impoverished countries are getting worse. To tackle this, some suggest that it is vital to help low-income nations. I believe that the idea of supporting poorer nations is morally right and will reduce global challenges, including international migration. \n\nOne leading cause why giving monetary aid to poorer nations is that it is morally right. Because rich countries can afford to support people in distressed regions, it could be ethically wrong not to help suffering nations who lack basics such as food, water and medicine. This is particularly important during difficult times when high inflation and food crises impact disproportionately poorer countries. \n\nAdditionally, another primary reason why helping poorer nations is that it can contribute to the reduction of international migration. Factors such as lack of shelter, food and other essentials contribute to the increase of people escaping from their well-off countries to wealthier nations in search of a better life. Therefore, providing these nations with financial support in their homeland is crucial. \n\nHowever, it is also necessary that poorer nations take the initiative to improve their situations. In the long term, monetary assistance from Western countries is not sustainable because they will not be able to support other countries persistently in the long run. Authorities in poorer nations should, for instance, increase the quality of their institutions and create jobs and businesses. \n\nTo conclude, helping poorer countries is vital for different reasons, including that it can give us a greater sense of humanity, and diminish global migration, as refugees are supported in their places. However, governments in impoverished countries should engage in finding solutions for their problems and strive to create opportunities for their citizens, incorporating employment opportunities for their nationals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va da de cap den y tuong chinh ve viec cac quoc gia giau can giup do cac quoc gia ngheo hon.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many students find it difficult to concentrate or pay attention at school. What are the reasons? What could be done to solve this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"Some people argue that most students have difficulty focusing on classes. This essay will examine the main reasons for this argument and possible solutions to it.\n\nMost of the students wake up very early for their busy schedules and feel sleepy in the first classes at school which makes it really hard to focus on any subject. Furthermore, there are generally many long and sequential course sessions, with boring and unattractive formats in general, with little breaks in between, which disables the students to recharge and energize herself/himself to get ready to learn new subjects. For instance, researchers published that teenagers' focus time is only 16 minutes, after that they got either distracted or bored. In that case, it does not make sense to hold up 40 mins sessions. In addition, technological devices such as tablets and smartphones are the top distractions, even one notification on the phone is enough to ruin the concentration of the students.\n\nA possible solution can be a new arrangement of the time and content schedules at schools considering the new generations' challenges and advantages. Maybe arranging shorter sessions with more little breaks can help students to concentrate better. Besides, the formats of the contents might be more fun with gamification and usage of more attractive visuals and experiments if applicable. Another solution could be prohibiting smart devices throughout the learning time which blocks the possibility of being disturbed by them when focused.\n\nIn conclusion, the misarrangement of time and content format and smart devices can cause students to lose their focus, even though rearrangement of the school days and prohibiting smart devices can help the problem.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBan da tra loi phan Task Response trong bai viet cua minh mot cach tuong doi tot.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that zoos are inhumane and should be closed down. Others argue that zoos play an important role in wildlife conservation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, we have zoos all around the world to preserve endangered animals and to the purpose of introducing these animals to people. While some people think that zoos are necessary to protect wildlife animals others believe that this lifestyle is not acceptable for animals and should not be allowed. I will discuss both viewpoints and elaborate the reasons why I side with the latter opinion defending that putting animals in a small place for a lifetime is unacceptable. \n\nOn the one hand, zoos might play an important role in protecting endangered species by providing them with essential conditions to survive. Since the biggest issue in the wild is difficulty to find food and water sources, zoos can help the animals by providing these basic needs. Furthermore, these controlled places might give a chance for treatment to animals with serious injuries and help to increase their lifetime. More than that, with controlled breeding next generations could be produced and animal genes can be preserved.\n\nOn the other hand, removing animals from their natural habitats can lead to a lot of problems such as an imbalance in nature. For instance, removing one animal from the food chain can affect all other species in the food pyramid. Therefore, as all the natural balance would be affected negatively changing the natural system should not be that easy. Besides all of these, putting an animal in a very small living place can cause a lot of behavioural disorders also. Consequently, these disorders will lead to other mental and physical conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, there are some believers that menageries are necessary to keep wild animals alive and protect their generations for long years whereas others argue that zoos are inhumane places for animals as they are way smaller than animals need and change balance of the nature. I believe animal welfare is more important than everything and the protection of endangered species can be done without changing their natural habitats. I opine zoos have gone out of their purpose and have become touristic places only. Therefore, as a veterinarian, I believe as these conditions cause more problems than help, zoos are unacceptable places for animals.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTask Response: Trong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va dua ra ca hai quan diem khac nhau ve vai tro cua so thu.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people believe that after a child enters school their children will have more influence than their parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"School is an institution for feeding children and some people think this is everything for children's growth. However, we are not able to reduce the parent's effect on their kids. Parents are the basis of children. In the following, I will explain this view in more depth.\n\nFirstly, children have been grown from their parents all of their lives before entering the school. They stem from parents so parents are their personality's roots. School is the institution for developing  children's lives' knowledge to make them go to  society safely. I also grew up like these children. I learned basic social skills from my parents and go to the school which was the place to improve and apply the skills. Hence, even after children entered school, the parent's role is still available and influential.\n\nSecondly, children think that their parents are fundamental to their lives and  school is a part of their lifestyle. For example, when I was younger, I didn't think that school is more influential than my parents. I lived my life in school with the people skills which I learned at home and when after the classes finished I always thought that I was coming back to my parents. This is why I believe parents are more impactive than school.\n\nTo summarize, children's growth fundamental is their parents and this can't be ignored. School is a role in improving what children learned from their parents. Indeed, children also know that they are from their parents and school is a part of their lives. In conclusion, therefore, I disagree that school affects children more than parents.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi cua de bai mot cach tuong doi, tuy nhien, y tuong cua ban chua duoc mo rong va phat trien day du.

This essay will discuss pron and corn and who will tackle it.\n\nOn the one hand, Nowadays, individuals faced a number of problems such as traffic because  the urban areas are hubs of industries and people are doing jobs and business in metropolitan cities for work. However, there are a plethora of facilities available kind as shopping malls, stores, hospitality and a modern lifestyle so people  attack  cities. For example, Ludhiana city is the most crowded city in Punjab it is  very famous for hosiery goods and there are numerous biggest industries as well as traffic and accommodation are large problems for individuals.\n\nFurthermore, Due to industries natural air is polluted and everyone is aware of this problem So now the government takes steps against companies that are all industries shifted to the countryside so that, authorities develop and increase space for accommodation and solve traffic issues. while  there are many determinants like urban to rural areas and distance so far so it is very difficult for she/he and it creates traffic in also village areas. For example, companies need many things for imports and export  they spend huge money on transportation. Moreover, these companies add extra charges on products amounting to tax and delivery charges which is difficult for consumers and company expenses. For instance, I ordered a parcel from Amazon about they added a huge amount as delivery charges because there was no store nearby.\n\nIn conclusion, Government take a good decision because it is mandatory to remove traffic and accommodation problems.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Write about the following topic.\n\nInternet social media have become very popular. To what extent do you think this is a good or bad thing? Why do you think this is the case?\n\nGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nYou should spend about 40 minutes on this task.\"\nEssay:\n\"The internet is undoubtedly one of the most important inventions of this century. High-speed internet has become widely available, leading to the increased popularity of social media. Most people nowadays possess at least one social media account. While some people argue that social media might be beneficial to some extent, I do believe that the massive use of social media is detrimental to our society.\n\nTo begin with, it may be true that internet platforms may provide users with  opportunities to communicate with people around the world, enabling them to share ideas or inspiring stories. Also, in some ,people use social media for business. As we can see on Facebook feeds or Instagram posts, many young entrepreneurs advertise their original products on their social media accounts. Thus, social media indeed have advantageous effects. However, over popularity of these online platforms has created appalling effects on our society. First, loss of privacy. Teenagers and young people tend to post every activity that they do. For example, I see tons of videos and pictures that I feel are inappropriate to be posted publicly such as kissing, drinking or dancing half-naked. This, in my opinion, could exert negative consequences including crimes. \n\nIn addition, social media could also increase consumerism. Social media is full of artists and public figures who always introduce new trends in clothing or advertise cutting-edge gadgets. Indeed, the public will feel the pressure to buy or own the advertised products, even though they do not need them at all.\n\nIn conclusion, although social media may allow  users to keep in touch with their families and friends, I believe that it has detrimental effects on our society such as loss of privacy and increase consumerism behaviour.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va neu ro quan diem cua minh rang viec su dung mang xa hoi la mot viec khong tot cho xa hoi.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, some employers think that formal academic qualifications are more important than life experience or personal qualities when they look for new employees. Why is it the case? To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"There is a controversial statement heating up a debate over the fact that some recruiters favour candidates who have formal credentials for study over those with only life experience or good personality traits in today's society. This essay will look at some causes of this and I personally do not have a consensus with this idea.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, academic degrees are valued more than life experience and character by some employers when they seek new staff. Because they believe that potential employees with an excellent qualification are equipped with in-depth knowledge and useful skills which play a crucial part in their future careers. For instance, some leading technology firms, namely FPT, Vingroup and so on, highly appreciate prospective workers who have Information Technology degrees or Internet Engineering certificates, therefore an improved quality of life for candidates who take them. Hence, taking academic background as a priority in recruit procedures exerts certain virtues.\n\nWhile the necessity of having a distinction degree is widely acknowledged, personalities and life experiences are vital for new hires as well. The majority of the skills needed for a job can be acquired through experience, which helps people deal with difficult situations more effectively. Take social and communication skills as two examples, these can be trained and practiced through experiencing ups and downs in life, so that it will make contributions to their jobs. Thus, it is detrimental to assess one’s working ability based merely on their academic performance.\n\nIn conclusion, although academic qualifications can have certain values, it should not be regarded as the only and the most important factor to select the best workers.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dua ra mot so nguyen nhan cua viec nha tuyen dung coi trong bang cap hon kinh nghiem va pham chat ca nhan.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Technology is being used more and more in education. Some people say that this is a positive trend, while others argue that it is leading to negative consequences.\n\nDiscuss both sides of this argument and then give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly common for teachers to use technology in their classes. Some people believe that it is a positive trend, while others think that it will bring negative effects. In fact, I side with those who think that technology brings positive impacts.\n\nOn the one hand, technology helps students to improve their abilities. In the class, many materials need improved technology to make the students understand better such as science. By having technology in the class, teachers can use many creative varieties in the class. For instance, students can see the real process of photosynthesis by using improved technology. As a result, the student can achieve academic success.\n\nOn the other hand, technology can replace the teacher's position in the class. By providing technology in the class, teachers will get less interaction with the pupils. Many activities will be served with the technology. The teachers do not have to explain the material. For illustration, teachers just have to provide the video of the cells in the class without having an explanation from the beginning in front of the class. Consequently, teachers will not be the centre of the class.\n\nTo sum up, an increasing number of people using technology in class have controversy in society. Many people believe that it will make bad effects on the class such as replacing the role of the teachers. However, I am firmly convinced that having technology in the class will be helpful such as making the student understand the material better which can improve their academic success.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTren co so phan tich va so sanh voi yeu cau cua de bai, trong phan Task Response, bai viet cua ban dap ung duoc mot phan yeu cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"There are more workers to work from home and more students to study from home. This is because the computer technology is more and more easily accessible and cheaper. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is commonly argued that more workers and students work and study from home because computer technology is more and more easily accessible and cheaper. Personally, I can neither completely agree nor disagree with this statement for a variety of reasons.\n\nI partly agree that people work and study from home is positive. One of the main reasons can be that working and studying with individual computers at home saves bulk time and money. This means that doing everything from home does not take commuting time as well as traffic fees such as vehicle tickets, and fuel. Another reason can be that using their computers at home make working and studying flexible time because computer technology is more and more easily accessible and cheaper. For example, anyone who works from home has time to work and take care of themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the viewpoint that doing work and studying from home is positive. Firstly,  working and studying from home does not have the opportunity to debate with their colleagues and friends. For example, those who work from home cannot meet face-to-face colleagues to discuss a problem. Secondly, using individual at home is unmanaged by the supervisor of the company make them can lose focus while working. For instance, while using the computer at home make they play more games, not work.\n\nIn conclusion, although working and studying from home with the computer is more and more easily accessible and cheaper.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people get into debt by buying things they don�t need and can�t afford.\n\n\n\nWhat are the reasons for this behaviour?\n\n\n\nWhat action can be taken to prevent people from having this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"Nowadays, some individuals have financial problems because they overuse their money by consuming goods that are useless for them. This essay will discuss the reasons behind this phenomenon and provide practical solutions to address the issue.\n\n\n\nPeople purchase consumptions that they do not need and get into debt because they lack basic knowledge of personal asset management. That is because the education system we have in the contemporary era only focuses on theoretical knowledge without providing basic tools for students to live their daily lives, leading to a sufficient sense of investment and saving after they grow up. Therefore, people tend to use every quarter in their pocket for consumption without considering their financial situations, and this can harm them in the long term as they need to work twice hard to pay back their debts and have no time for further developments in both personal and professional settings. For example, according to a survey about college graduates in China, the major problem of their school curriculums is the lack of basic finance and investment courses, which may prevent them from over-consumption after they graduate.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem, the general public, financial institutions and governments should act together in an endeavour. On an individual level, people can use the Internet to self-study related knowledge about asset management and proper consumption behaviours. In addition, banks and other financial authorities should publish more strict regulations to loan money to people for consumption, which can prevent people from over-consumption in the early stage. Finally, governments should restrict education systems by adding financial courses into curricula, teaching students from primary school, and developing their purchase hygiene gradually. For instance, the Japanese government forced all the elementary schools to set up a pocket money course in which students can learn about the different ways to use their money and the according results, which was highly commented by citizens.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, some people struggle with their consumption debts for useless things because they have insufficient knowledge about asset management and have no plan for their consumption in advance. All the individuals by learning financial knowledge, banks by setting strictly examining progress of loan, and governments by adjusting curriculums and adding consumption practices for students can help to address the issue.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban xu ly chu de dung va tra loi cau hoi de bai mot cach ro rang.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?\"\nEssay:\n\"It is believed by a group of social members that sounds are a suitable way of connecting members of society of various cultures and ages with one another. I totally agree with this opinion due to the reasons which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. \n\n\n\nOn one hand, humankind has been always attracted to  sounds and rhythms, even from the time he lived in a cave and the only available music was the sound of nature which was mainly produced by water and wind movements or animals. So this characteristic is rooted in our souls. No matter where a person was born or what culture he grew up in, there is a special kind of song which will absorb his attention. Recent research and investigations show that even wildlife creatures, such as birds or camels can understand music and sync their movements with it, and there is no doubt that humans are absolutely ahead of them in this area.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, expressing feelings and opening up can bring people together and as we know a vital role of song is talking about feelings which are commonly hidden or forgotten to show. These days, there are many applications like the website which is called Genius that provide lyrics and the metaphors or symbols which are behind them. society usually leaves their own opinions or vote for other�s ideas and even in some cases, they have long discussions over albums or tracks that have been released recently or a long time ago. \n\n\n\nTo sum up, music was popular among human beings from the very beginning of their lives and it is the food of their souls, and it also can be a bridge for transferring emotions facts that are not usually discussed without the existence of songs because people find it difficult to expose them. As discussed in the above paragraphs, I totally agree with the idea that song is a good way of bringing people of different ages and nations together.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nCau tra loi cua ban phan lon dap ung dung yeu cau cua de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"People find it difficult to speak in front of the public or to give a presentation.\n\n\n\nHow important is to speak well in public.\n\n\n\nDo you think children at school should be taught public speaking?\"\nEssay:\n\"Giving a speech in front of many people is a huge ability in  modern times. Although many crowds are ashamed if they can not speak with the public, this skill is crucial for both communication and society.\n\n\n\nIn addition, I think that all educational institutions have to teach the students this skill properly, and the following expository paragraphs will expatiate both stances with lucid examples.\n\n\n\nFirstly, in a competitive society, in which public speaking is requiring all occupations rather than knowledge, the majority of the community is laying more emphasis on their communication ability. It shows that this capability will be increasingly commonplace in all countries as well as learning this kind of mastery will give us tremendous opportunities in the future. For example, many influencers such as Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and so on, specialized not only in public speaking but also in charisma which is important to attract someone's attention.\n\n\n\nSecondly, in some highly developed countries schools, teach their pupils how to speak in front of many nations, as a result, a study has proven that most of them greatly impact their jobs and get success easily because public speaking is more improved than the other staff. Nevertheless, a minority of school is introducing this system into their regions, the result is still unprecedented. If all nations utilize this technique, the territories' life quality will be better in a very short time.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, we all should learn this talent to advance our lives and out of our comfort zone to the bright prospect because communication with others is an inseparable part of life.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang viec neu ro tinh quan trong cua kha nang noi truoc cong chung va de xuat rang tre em nen duoc day cach noi truoc cong chung.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many students find it difficult to concentrate or pay attention at school. What are the reasons? What could be done to solve this problem?\"\nEssay:\n\"Many learners struggle to focus in different learning institutions. The reasons for this are that the human brain has a limited time limit for concentrating, and students have many distractions at school, such as friends and sports. These challenges can be resolved by creating many breaks during learning and making the learning process interesting or fun. It is also prudent to set aside time for school work or study to curb the effects of distractions. This essay will discuss these matters at length. \n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, it is difficult for many students to concentrate at school because the human brain can only concentrate for a short period, the reason why many lessons are scheduled with several breaks. Likewise, there are so many distractions at school such as friends and sporting activities; these divert attention away from learning. For example, it has been found by studies in several schools in the USA, that when students make friends, they stop paying attention to their studies and become interested in games and leisure activities with their mates. \n\n\n\nTo resolve these issues, first, parents and teachers should assist the learners to create and follow set timetables for individual study. At such times, they must give all their attention to learning rather than playing. Secondly, learning institutions need to create many breaks for students so that their brains can regain composure and strength; learning must also be made more fun, as in the case of many learn-through-play activities which allow for more relaxation and concentration. For instance, in the same studies conducted in the USA, it was found that teachers resorted to using games and other interactive learning methods to promote concentration. These improved the pass rates in the schools surveyed. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, focusing at school is a problem for learners because of the distractions they encounter, such as their friends, but also because their brains can only assimilate small amounts of information at a time. The solutions to these issues are to make learning fun and to create as many breaks as possible to re-energise the brain. These are the issues the essay has discussed.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nBai viet cua ban da tra loi dung cau hoi cua de bai, ban luan ve ly do tai sao hoc sinh gap kho khan trong viec tap trung o truong va de xuat cach giai quyet van de nay.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Many university students want to learn about different subjects in addition to their main subjects. Others feel it is more important to give all their time and attention to studying for their qualification.\n\n\n\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is often argued by numerous undergraduates who desire to study various subjects as well as their regular modules. However, others opine that it is elevated to put all your efforts into academic studies. This essay will discuss both views, as far as I am concerned I am in favour of the latter notion.\n\n\n\nTo commence with, most admissions intend to learn about different subjects in addition to their main courses.  To explain it, the majority of the extra disciplines are most likely simple and interesting, which helps enlistment to keep their minds fresh. It is also advantageous in a way so that they can think out of the box and make some strong decisions in different aspects of life.For instance, a survey conducted by oxford university in Britain found that 33% of individuals have different jobs as compared to their degrees.\n\n\n\nOther opinions said that by studying subjects according to their qualification, recruitment will be much more comfortable and enjoyable and this will make them feel more confident to deal with various challenges in the learning process. Besides, by focusing on courses that the university offers, students will make specialised knowledge and expertise to prepare themselves to enter the job market in many corporations, which means that they will be much more ready to dedicate themselves to our society.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, I contend that universities should offer programs according to the student qualification because it will make them become specialised in the course they learned and this will lead them to become professionals and experts in their field in the future.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da dua ra hai quan diem khac nhau va to ra ung ho y tuong rang viec tap trung vao hoc tap va nghien cuu chuyen sau la quan trong hon viec hoc cac mon hoc khac.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people argue that all experimentation on animals is bad and should be outlawed. However, others believe that important scientific discoveries can be made from animal experiments.\n\n\n\nCan experimentation on animals be justified? Are there any alternatives?\"\nEssay:\n\"In the past, animal experiments are totally acceptable and necessary. Nowadays, due to technological improvements, this type of experimentation could reduce. This essay will argue about these experiences and the alternatives that already exist. \n\n\n\nIn the early twenty century, animals were vital for experiments in order to obtain knowledge and learn about the body system's works. Because of them, in all these years, everybody can take medicine and use cosmetic products safely. For instance, in the past, animal test had not used in a specific type of medicine for pregnancy, and the result was the members deformation of many babies, as well as an eyelash cosmetic that was also not tested on animals which ended up to made blind people who used it. Therefore, humanity's health security enhance, and the lifespan grew due to animal experiments. \n\n\n\nCurrently, advancing technology is paramount to reducing these tests, and more comprehension of the cruelty methodology used is essential to change the methods to avoid animal suffering. In addition, some countries have already prohibited animal utilization for some types of procedures, demanding the utilization of new techniques such as 3-D cells and in vitro cells cultivated. For example, the Natura and Boticario Brazilian companies have not done any tests on animals for roughly twenty years. Hence, the development of biotechnology could reduce the usefulness of animals.\n\n\n\nIn summary, this essay approached the evolution of animal tests' necessity in the past and how they could be replaced throughout the years by the advance of technology.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai va dua ra quan diem ve viec lieu cuoc thu nghiem tren dong vat co the chung minh duoc khong.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"If we want to solve global problems, countries must learn to collaborate more and compete less. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\"\nEssay:\n\"The problems governments face nowadays are often shared by other countries. Many regions of the world suffer from extreme weather, internet crime and large population movements. Is it better to deal with these problems through collaboration or competition? I believe that competition is more effective.\n\n\n\nFirstly, collaboration can be a very slow process. Although communication technology has improved greatly, countries that choose to collaborate still must work together across great distances using different languages. Relationships between leaders may develop slowly or even deteriorate as they negotiate across linguistic and cultural divisions. Political leaders may therefore lose trust in each other.\n\n\n\nThe second reason for my view is that attempts to collaborate are often unsuccessful. Countries with different aims and values often find it hard to work together, and the need to compromise often means that solutions become less effective. International agreements on climate change, for example, tend to lack ambition. Any failure to agree may even damage relationships between states. But if countries act individually, they can act more quickly and other countries might then gain from their experience.\n\n\n\n Lastly, I think that people tend to work harder when they compete. In the same way that businesses innovate in response to competition, competing countries may look for innovative solutions as they try to win respect from the international community. In fact, as a result of competition, several quite different solutions may be developed, and the world may benefit from a greater range of options.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, collaboration represents a less effective process for solving problems than competition. There will always be some need to collaborate, for example, when resolving conflict. But if we want to solve problems, it's essential that we take advantage of friendly competition.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi cau hoi tu de bai bang cach cho biet quan diem cua minh la canh tranh la hieu qua hon trong viec giai quyet cac van de toan cau.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Nowadays, a growing number of people with health problems are trying alternative medicines and treatments instead of visiting their usual doctor. Do you thing this is a positive or a negative development?\"\nEssay:\n\"More and more individuals are turning to alternative medicines and treatments instead of seeking traditional medical advice. In my view, this trend is concerning and can be deemed as a negative development due to the potential risks involved, such as inappropriate cures and financial exploitation.\n\n\n\nOne significant drawback of opting for unconventional treatments is the risk of exacerbating health issues. People may seek alternative options due to various reasons, such as financial constraints, prior unsuccessful treatments, or living in remote areas. However, if they receive treatment from individuals lacking proper medical knowledge, it can be hazardous to their well-being. Relying on medicines from unreliable sources or the internet may adversely affect the patient's symptoms, leading to a deterioration of their health condition.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, this growing inclination towards alternative treatments presents an opportunity for scammers to take advantage of vulnerable patients. Desperate for relief from their ailments, some patients might fall prey to fraudulent individuals offering expensive yet baseless guarantees of a cure. Those who have lost hope in traditional medicine become susceptible to these scams, unknowingly subjecting themselves to financial exploitation.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, while the popularity of alternative treatments may be on the rise, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks associated with such practices. Opting for treatments without proper medical guidance can lead to adverse consequences for patients, jeopardizing their health and finances. Therefore, it is imperative for individuals to exercise caution and seek advice from qualified medical professionals to ensure the best possible care and outcomes for their well-being.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi chinh xac cau hoi de bai bang cach cho rang xu huong su dung phuong phap dieu tri thay the la mot phat trien tieu cuc.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Car ownership has increased so rapidly over the past thirty years that in many cities around the world, there are constant traffic jams. How true do you think this statement is? What measures can governments take to discourage people from owning cars?\"\nEssay:\n\"The entire world is fascinated by technical breakthroughs in this fast-advancing scientific era. Over the past three decades, car ownership has increased significantly and at a never-before-seen rate. Traffic is now extremely congested as a result of this. In my opinion, governments may undoubtedly start some suggested efforts to control this threat.\n\n\n\nSetting the stage for the discussion, the purchase and use of private cars have evolved significantly during the past few decades. The flexibility of commuting is probably the most significant of the many reasons why many people prefer to possess their own automobiles. Many people also express great enthusiasm for the new vehicles that have been introduced to the market since they have advanced features, innovation, security features, and luxury. As a result, there are more vehicles on the road than the roads and passengers can handle, which leads to traffic congestion. Furthermore, many governments in developing nations take the least care to construct additional roads and appropriate parking spaces, and their actions further exacerbate the traffic issues.\n\n\n\nSupporting my viewpoint further, governments can impose strict rules to cut down on car ownership and manage traffic jams. In order to decrease the chaos caused by traffic jams, the government should prioritize developing enough parking lots, new highways, and flyovers. It should also actively promote encouraging individuals to walk and ride bikes wherever possible. Additionally, the government has to persuade commuters to ditch their automobiles in favour of less expensive public transit options like buses and metro trains. Finally, and most crucially, the government must raise auto ownership taxes while also enhancing public transportation options to deter as many people as possible from buying cars.\n\n\n\nTo summarize, strong steps should be taken by the appropriate authorities to limit the number of cars on the road in order to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. congestion. In addition, individuals should be educated on the advantages of biking and walking as modes of transportation.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi day du hai cau hoi trong de bai.

{"prompt": "Topic:\n\"Some people say that advertising is extremely successful at persuading us to buy things. Other people think that advertising is so common that we no longer pay attention to it. \n\n\n\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\nEssay:\n\"It is a controversial subject whether advertisement is still a useful way to persuade people to purchase some products or it has lost its efficiency to draw others attention to a particular commodity. In this essay, I will explain some reasons behind both these points of view as well as express the reason why I am on the first side.\n\n\n\nTo proponents of advertising, it is an undeniable fact that it still has its popularity among each society due to some points. The main obvious one is that if they were skillfully designed, they would hit the market with an influx of customers. In other words, the role of using fascinating visual effects has become highlighted so that it can be still a compelling way in which products can be sold. Another further reason would be that although the market competition has been fierce in the last decade, advertising is still the first and foremost way to persuade people to buy some products, but it has just changed its platforms. For example, advertisements had been shown on television in the gap between two movies in the past, however, it has been represented on YouTube or the Netflix website now.\n\n\n\nOn the other side, opponents of advertisement efficiency believe that with the influx of different kinds of advertisement, they have lost their functions so people are not persuaded by them anymore. They consider this competitive market a recession of advertising, not a chance to boost its quality.  for instance, many elderlies skip the advertisements between the program they are watching because they believe all of them are designed to deceive them. \n\n\n\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that some people do not agree with the functions of ads, I firmly believe that ads can be kept in their publicity as long as experts are professional enough to make ads in an appealing way.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Task Response:\nTrong bai viet cua ban, ban da tra loi dung cau hoi de bai bang cach de cap den ca hai quan diem trong van de.
